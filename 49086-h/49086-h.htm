<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This book is an attempt to present the life of Thomas Cromwell as a statesman,
and to estimate his work without religious bias. Though it would certainly be
difficult to overrate his importance in the history of the Church of England, I
maintain that the motives that inspired his actions were invariably political,
and that the many ecclesiastical changes carried through under his guidance were
but incidents of his administration, not ends in themselves. Consequently any
attempt to judge him from a distinctively religious standpoint, whether Catholic
or Protestant, can hardly fail, it seems to me, to mislead the student and obscure
the truth. I cannot agree, on the other hand, with those who have represented
Cromwell as a purely selfish political adventurer, the subservient instrument of
a wicked master, bent only on his own gain. It seems to me as idle to disparage
his patriotism and statesmanship, as it is to try to make him out a hero of the
Reformation. He merits a place far higher than that of most men of his type, a
type essentially characteristic of the sixteenth century, a type of which the
Earl of Warwick in England and Maurice of Saxony on the Continent are striking
examples, a type that profoundly influenced the destinies of Protestantism, but
to which theological issues were either a mere nothing, or else totally subordinate
to political considerations.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></p>

<p>It has been justly said that Cromwell’s correspondence is our chief source of
information for the period immediately following the breach with Rome. To
transcribe <i>in extenso</i> the letters he received would be almost the task of
a lifetime; for they form the bulk of the enormous mass of material with which
the editors of the Calendars of State Papers for the years 1533–1540 have had to
deal. But the number of extant letters he wrote is, comparatively speaking,
extremely small; it has therefore been possible to make full copies of them in
every case, and I trust that the many advantages—linguistic as well as
historical—that can only be secured by complete, and as far as possible accurate
transcriptions of the originals, will be accepted as sufficient reason for
editing this collection of documents, twenty-one of which have neither been
printed nor calendared before. The rules that have been observed in transcription
will be found in the <a href="#Page_311">Prefatory Note</a>
(vol. i. p. 311). The Calendar references to the more important letters received
by Cromwell, where they bear directly on those he wrote, are given in the notes
at the end of the second volume.</p>

<p>My warmest thanks are due to Mr. F. York Powell, Regius Professor of Modern
History in the University of Oxford, who has guided me throughout in matter,
form, and style; and to my friend and master Mr. A. L. Smith, Fellow of Balliol
College, whose advice and encouragement have been an inspiration from first to
last. It is not easy for me to express how much I have depended on their
suggestions and criticism. I am indebted to Mr. Owen Edwards, Fellow of Lincoln
College, for indispensable help in the early stages of my work. The main plan of
this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v">[v]</a></span> book is in many respects
similar to that of his Lothian Essay for the year 1887, which I regret that he
has never published. My grateful acknowledgements are also due to Mr. James
Gairdner of the Public Record Office for information about Cromwell’s early life;
to Professor Dr. Max Lenz, of the University of Berlin, for helpful suggestions
in connexion with the Anglo-German negotiations in the years 1537–1540; and to
Mr. G. T. Lapsley, of the University of California, for similar services in
regard to the Pilgrimage of Grace, and the reorganization of the North after the
suppression of the rebellion.</p>

<p>I beg to express my appreciation of the kindness of the Duke of Rutland, the
Marquess of Salisbury, Earl Spencer, Lord Calthorpe, William Berington, Esq.,
and Alfred Henry Huth, Esq., in giving me access to the manuscripts in their
private collections.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to thank the officials of the Public Record Office,
British Museum, Heralds’ College of Arms, and Bodleian Library, for facilitating
my work in every way; more especially Messrs. Hubert Hall, R. H. Brodie, E.
Salisbury, and F. B. Bickley, who have repeatedly aided me in my search for
uncalendared letters and continental documents, and in deciphering the most
difficult manuscripts I have had to consult.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot1">THE ANCESTRY AND EARLY LIFE OF THOMAS CROMWELL</p>

<p>The manor of Wimbledon comprises the parishes of Wimbledon, Putney, Roehampton,
Mortlake, and East Sheen, and parts of Wandsworth and Barnes<a id="FNanchor_1_1"/><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.
In West Saxon times it was one of the estates of the see of Canterbury, but after
the Conquest it was seized by Odo, the high-handed Bishop of Bayeux: in 1071,
however, it was recovered by Lanfranc, and with one trifling interruption in the
reign of Richard II., it remained in the possession of the archbishopric until
1535. In that year Cranmer surrendered it to Henry VIII. in exchange for the
priory of St. Rhadegund in Dover, and a little later the King granted it to
Thomas Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_2_2"/><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
who was born there some fifty years before, the son of a well-to-do blacksmith,
brewer, and fuller. The early history of the manor of Wimbledon is almost
unknown, for we do not possess its Court Rolls prior to the year 1461: they were
probably lost or destroyed during the Wars of the Roses. After 1461, however,
they are continuous, with the exception of the years 1473 and 1474.</p>

<p>An entry in these rolls, written in the year 1475, states that ‘Walter Smyth
and his father keep thirty sheep on Putney Common, where they have no common<a id="FNanchor_3_3"/><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.’
A number of subsequent mentions of this same Walter Smyth shows that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
was also called Walter Cromwell. The name Walter Cromwell occurs more than
ninety times in the rolls, and the name Walter Smyth at least forty times. That
both these names stand for the same person is proved by one entry written,
‘Walter Cromwell alias Walter Smyth,’ by two written, ‘Walter Smyth alias
Cromwell,’ and by five written, ‘Walter Cromwell alias Smyth.’ Who then was this
Walter Cromwell, whence did he come, and how did he acquire this double name?</p>

<p>The Cromwell family did not originate in Wimbledon. An entry in the Close Roll
of Edward IV. states that in the year 1461 John Cromwell, son of William Cromwell,
late of Norwell in Nottinghamshire, surrendered his right in Parkersplace,
Kendalsland and other property there to Master John Porter, prebendary of
Palishall<a id="FNanchor_4_4"/><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>.
Mr. John Phillips of Putney further informs us that nine years before John
Cromwell gave up his lands in Norwell, he was granted the twenty-one years’
lease of a fulling-mill and house in Wimbledon by Archbishop Kempe, lord of the
manor, and had moved there with his family<a id="FNanchor_5_5"/><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
It would be interesting to know what Mr. Phillips’ authority for this statement
is: unfortunately he has given no reference for it. But whatever the precise
date and circumstances of their change of home, there can be little doubt that
the Cromwells migrated to Wimbledon from Norwell some time before 1461. There is
plenty of evidence in the Court Rolls to show that Walter Smyth alias Cromwell
was the son of John Cromwell, and the entry of 1475 proves that they were both
in Wimbledon in that year. The family in Nottinghamshire from which they sprung
was well-known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> and well-off;
both John Cromwell’s father William and his grandfather Ralph were persons of
wealth and position there<a id="FNanchor_6_6"/><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>.</p>

<p>Several entries in the Court Rolls indicate that John Cromwell’s wife was the
 sister of a certain William Smyth, who is often mentioned as ‘William Smyth
armourer,’ and sometimes as ‘William Armourer.’ It seems probable that this
William Smyth came with John Cromwell to Wimbledon from Norwell, and the entries
in the manorial records show that he lived there with his brother-in-law. There
is also reason to believe that the latter’s son Walter was apprenticed to him
during his younger days, and so acquired the name Smyth.</p>

<p>Walter Cromwell grew up as a brewer, smith, and fuller in Putney. He had an
elder brother named John, who moved to Lambeth and settled down there to a quiet
and prosperous life as a brewer, later, according to Chapuys, becoming cook to
the Archbishop of Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_7_7"/><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.
Walter, however, remained in Wimbledon, and appears to have been a most
quarrelsome and riotous character. Most of the entries in the Court Rolls
concerning him are records of small fines incurred for petty offences. Forty-eight
times between 1475 and 1501 was he forced to pay sixpence for breaking the assize
of ale. In order to prevent the sale of bad beer in those days, an ale-taster was
appointed to pass, or condemn as unfit, all brewing in the parish. Walter
Cromwell did not go to the ale-taster before he drew and sold his beer, and for
failing so to do was fined as aforesaid. There is also record that he was not
seldom drunk. In 1477 a penalty of twenty pence was inflicted on him for
assaulting and drawing blood from William Michell, and he and his father were
very often brought before the court on the charge of ‘overburthening’ the public
land in Putney with their cattle, and cutting more than their share of the furze
and thorns there<a id="FNanchor_8_8"/><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.
But in spite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> of all these
petty misdemeanours, Walter Cromwell appears to have been a man of property and
influence in Wimbledon, and the Court Rolls in 1480 show that he then possessed
two virgates of land in Putney parish. To these were added six more virgates in
1500 by grant of Archbishop Morton<a id="FNanchor_9_9"/><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>.
Walter Cromwell was also made Constable of Putney in 1495<a id="FNanchor_10_10"/><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
and his name constantly occurs in the Court Rolls as decenarius and
juryman<a id="FNanchor_11_11"/><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>.
Towards the end of his life, however, his character appears to have become so
bad that he forfeited all his position and property in Wimbledon. In 1514 he
‘falsely and fraudulently erased the evidences and terrures of the lord,’ so
that the bedell was commanded ‘to seize into the lord’s hands all his copyholds
held of the lord and to answer the lord of the issue<a id="FNanchor_12_12"/><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.’
This is the last mention of the name of Walter Cromwell in the Wimbledon Manor Rolls.</p>

<p>Walter Cromwell’s wife was the aunt of a man named Nicholas Glossop, of
Wirksworth in Derbyshire<a id="FNanchor_13_13"/><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.
Mr. Phillips gives no reference for his statements that she was the daughter of
a yeoman named Glossop, and that she was residing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
in Putney at the house of an attorney named John Welbeck, at the time of her
marriage with Walter Cromwell in 1474<a id="FNanchor_14_14"/><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>;
but we have no evidence that these assertions are incorrect. At least two
daughters and one son were born to Walter Cromwell. He may have had other
children, but as there was no registration of births, marriages, or deaths in
England until 1538, we can only be certain of these three, of whom there are
mentions in the Court Rolls and in other contemporary records. The eldest
daughter Katherine, who was probably born about the year 1477, grew up and
married a young Welshman named Morgan Williams<a id="FNanchor_15_15"/><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
whose family had come to Putney from Llanishen in Glamorganshire. The Williamses
were a very important family in Putney, and John, the eldest of them, was a
successful lawyer and accountant, and steward to Lord Scales, who was then in
possession of a residence and some land in Putney parish. The youngest daughter
of Walter Cromwell was named Elizabeth. She married a sheep-farmer named
Wellyfed, who later joined his business to that of his father-in-law<a id="FNanchor_16_16"/><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>.
Christopher, the son of Elizabeth Cromwell and Wellyfed, grew up and was later
sent to school with his cousin Gregory, son of his mother’s brother
Thomas<a id="FNanchor_17_17"/><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>.
We are now in a position to examine the many conflicting statements concerning
the son of Walter Cromwell, the subject of this essay.</p>

<p>The traditional sources of information about Thomas Cromwell’s early life are
the characteristic but somewhat confusing stories of the martyrologist Foxe,
founded to some extent upon a novel of the Italian author Bandello, the meagre
though probably trustworthy accounts contained in Cardinal Pole’s ‘Apologia ad
Carolum Quintum,’ a letter of Chapuys to Granvelle written November 21, 1535,
and a few scattered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> statements
in the chroniclers of the period. To these were added in 1880 and 1882 the
results of the researches of Mr. John Phillips in the Wimbledon Manor
Rolls<a id="FNanchor_18_18"/><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.
Mr. Phillips has certainly brought to light a large number of interesting facts
about the ancestry and family of Thomas Cromwell: it is the more unfortunate
that he should have gone so far astray in some of his statements concerning the
man himself. He is surely correct in assuming Thomas to be the son of Walter
Cromwell; the evidence afforded by the State Papers leaves no doubt of this. He
is also right in stating that the name Thomas Cromwell does not occur in the
Court Rolls. But it is more difficult to believe the theory which Mr. Phillips
has evolved from these data. As he finds no entry concerning Thomas Cromwell in
the manorial records, he seeks for some mention of him under another appellation,
and hits upon that of Thomas Smyth as the most likely, owing to the fact that
his father was called by both surnames. He finds two entries in the Court Rolls
concerning Thomas Smyth, and assumes that they refer to Thomas Cromwell. These
entries occur in the records of Feb. 26, 1504, and of May 20 in the same year.
The first states that ‘Richard Williams came to the court and surrendered into
the hands of the lord two whole virgates of land in <span class="larger">‹</span>Roe<span class="larger">›</span>hampton, one called
Purycroft and the other called Williams, to the use of Thomas Smyth, his heirs
and assigns’; the second, that ‘Richard Williams assaulted Thomas [Smyth] and
beat the same Thomas against the peace of the lord the King,’ and further that
‘Thomas Smyth came to the court and surrendered into the hands of the lord two
whole virgates of land in Roehampton, one called Purycroft and the other called
Williams, to the use of David Doby, his heirs and assigns<a id="FNanchor_19_19"/><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>.’
Mr. Phillips has made these entries the basis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> for
 an attack on the veracity of many of the best-known stories of Bandello and
Foxe concerning the early life of our subject, but his whole case hangs on the
assumption that Thomas Smyth and Thomas Cromwell were one and the same man, and
until he can prove this ingenious but somewhat improbable theory his arguments
cannot be supported. He discusses at length the two entries in the Court Rolls,
adducing them as a proof of the falsity of the accounts which assert Cromwell to
have been in Italy previous to 1504, but concluding that the record that Thomas
Smyth disposed of his lands in Putney in May of that year indicates that Thomas
Cromwell left England at that time. To corroborate this last theory he refers to
the story of Chapuys that Cromwell was ill-behaved when young, and was forced
after an imprisonment to leave the country, and also asserts, in order still
further to strengthen his case, that ‘the Court Rolls contain nothing more
respecting Thomas Cromwell than what we have already stated<a id="FNanchor_20_20"/><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.’</p>

<p>It seems very extraordinary that Mr. Phillips should make this last statement
in view of his readiness to jump at the conclusion that Thomas Smyth and Thomas
Cromwell are identical. ‘Thomas Smyth,’ as a very cursory examination of the
Court Rolls will show, is mentioned therein every year from 1493 to 1529
(inclusive), except in 1494 and 1516. As there is certain evidence that Thomas
Cromwell was in other places during many of the years that Thomas Smyth was in
Wimbledon, it is clear that the two names cannot always stand for the same man.
The question which now arises is this: were there two Thomas Smyths, one of them
Thomas Cromwell and the other some other member of the Smyth family, perhaps a
descendant of William Smyth, armourer?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Or is the Thomas Smyth mentioned in the Court Rolls one man, and not Thomas
Cromwell at all?</p>

<p>The second theory seems on the whole more probable than the first. There are
no contradictory statements about Thomas Smyth in the rolls, nor is the name
mentioned twice in any of the lists of the Homage or Frank Pledge. Moreover had
there been two Thomas Smyths, one of whom was entitled to the name Cromwell, he
would almost certainly have been called so, in order to avoid confusion. On the
other hand, it scarcely seems likely that the son of Walter Cromwell should not
be mentioned at all in the Court Rolls. But this may be partially explained by
Chapuys’ account of his youthful wildness and early imprisonment; it seems quite
probable that he was a mere boy when he left his home. The evidence which we
possess certainly seems to strengthen the conclusion that there was but one
Thomas Smyth: the man mentioned in the Court Rolls by that name was probably a
descendant of William Smyth, armourer<a id="FNanchor_21_21"/><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>.
Surely none of the entries in the manorial records concerning Thomas Smyth can
be said to prove anything conclusive concerning the early life of the subject
of this essay. It has been the fashion to decry Bandello and Foxe and to
disbelieve all their stories, because of the undoubted confusion of dates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
which vitiates their testimony. But if no reliance can be placed on them, or
on Pole, Chapuys, and the chronicles of the period, must we not confess that our
knowledge of the early years of our subject’s life must reduce itself to an
interrogation point? Let us guard ourselves against accepting with implicit
faith the statements of these authors, but let us not cast them aside as utterly
worthless. Let us rather recognize that they still remain our most trustworthy
sources of information concerning the early life of Thomas Cromwell, and
therefore make a careful attempt to glean from their very confusing statements
the more probable facts concerning him.</p>

<p>None of the different accounts sheds any light upon the date of Cromwell’s
birth, but it is doubtful if it occurred later than 1485, in view of his probable
age at the time of his sojourn abroad. That he had a quarrel with his father
seems very likely: Bandello’s statement that he came to Italy, ‘fleeing from his
father,’ and Chapuys’ assertion that he was ill-behaved when young, together
with the many entries in the rolls concerning the tempestuous and disorderly
conduct of Walter Cromwell, all point to the truth of this story<a id="FNanchor_22_22"/><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
Foxe moreover asserts that Cromwell told Cranmer in later years ‘what a ruffian
he was in his younger days.’ Pole informs us that he soon became a roving
soldier in Italy, a statement which is borne out by the tales of Bandello and
Foxe that he was at the battle on the Garigliano (Dec. 28–29, 1503), in the
service of the French army<a id="FNanchor_23_23"/><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>.
The well-known story of the Italian novelist about Cromwell and Frescobaldo
the Florentine merchant, may well have some foundation in fact: there are
several mentions of Frescobaldo in the State Papers of the years 1530–1540,
which prove that Cromwell was intimate with an Italian of that name<a id="FNanchor_24_24"/><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.
Some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> scholars have gone so
far as to refuse to believe that Cromwell ever went to Italy at all; but this
must be the incredulity of madness in face of the fact that all our contemporary
witnesses agree that he went there, and of the evidence afforded by his wide
acquaintance with Italians, and by his knowledge of their language and literature.</p>

<p>From the date of the tale of Bandello up to 1512, the most probable story
concerning Cromwell’s life is that contained in Pole’s Apologia. It is there
stated that after his brief military career he became a merchant, but did not
remain a merchant long; and that he later attached himself as accountant to a
Venetian, whom Pole knew very well. Bandello informs us that Cromwell returned
to England after his stay in Florence; it seems more probable, however, that he
first went to Antwerp and engaged in trade there; for Foxe and Chapuys both
agree that he was in Flanders, and the former asserts that he was in the service
of English dealers in the Flemish marts. Another singular but characteristic
and not improbable story of the martyrologist strengthens the theory that
Cromwell was in Antwerp some time after the battle on the Garigliano. One
Geoffrey Chambers was sent to Rome as a representative of the Gild of Our Lady
in St. Botolph’s Church in Boston, to obtain from the Pope certain pardons or
indulgences by which the severe rules concerning Lenten observances might be
relaxed; and passing through Antwerp he fell in with Cromwell, whom he persuaded
to accompany him. The latter entered into the spirit of the enterprise; arrived
at Rome, he procured some choice sweetmeats and jellies, and armed with these
lay in wait for the Pope on his return from hunting. The delicacies were offered,
Julius was delighted with them, and granted the desired indulgences without delay.
Foxe states that this episode took place about the year 1510<a id="FNanchor_25_25"/><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[11]</a></p>

<p>This story seems to indicate that Cromwell went to Italy a second time. It
fits in well with Pole’s statement that after his military experience he became
first a merchant, and then a clerk to a Venetian trader. The absence of any
trustworthy chronology, however, prevents us from regarding any of the accounts
of these different writers as really historical; and when at last we meet with
a date on which we can rely, it is most tantalizing to find that the evidence
which is afforded us in connexion with it is of such a nature as to leave us
almost as much in the dark as before. In a letter written in June, 1536, a
certain mercer, by name George Elyot, addresses Cromwell as follows<a id="FNanchor_26_26"/><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>:
‘Ryght onourabyll sir my dewty Consethered as to youre Masterscheppe apertayneth
that hyt may plece your Masterscheppe For the love off god to Exceppe my Rewd
Maneres in thes behalf of wrytyng vnto you butt hyt ys onely to schowe yowre
Masterscheppe my pore mynd furste for the onour of god &amp; secondly For the
god love &amp; trew hartt that <span class="larger">‹</span>I<span class="larger">›</span> have howtt vnto you sensse the syngsson Martt
at medelborow in anno 1512.’ This quotation does not prove that Cromwell was at
the Syngsson Mart at Middelburg in 1512, nor does it shed much light on the
position he occupied at that time; still the probabilities strongly favour the
conclusion that he was either a merchant or a clerk to a merchant in the Low
Countries in 1512: the accounts of Foxe and Chapuys agree that he was in the
Netherlands in his younger days, and the letter of the mercer seems to fix the
date. We have also reason to believe that he was in London soon after this
practising as a solicitor. There exists in the Record Office a document dated
November, 1512, and endorsed, in a hand which certainly resembles that of
Cromwell’s later correspondence, ‘The tytle of the manour Whityngham for Mr.
Empson<a id="FNanchor_27_27"/><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>.’
The endorsement may of course be of a very different date from that of the
document itself; still the evidence which it affords is not utterly valueless,
especially as another reason for supposing that Cromwell returned to England in
1512, or soon after, is afforded by the fact that his marriage must have taken
place about this time:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> the
age of his son Gregory being such that it could scarcely have occurred much later.
The State Papers of 1512 give us more information concerning the early life of
Thomas Cromwell than those of any other year up to 1523. The sum total of the
evidence which they afford seems to indicate that he was in England and in the
Netherlands, that he was occupied both as a merchant and as a solicitor, and
that he was married in that year or soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s wife, to whom Chapuys refers as the daughter of a shearman, was
Elizabeth Wykys, descended from one of an ancient family of esquires, who was
gentleman-usher to Henry VII<a id="FNanchor_28_28"/><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.
A reference in Cromwell’s will of July 12, 1529, to one ‘Mercye Pryo<i>ur</i>’
as his mother-in-law<a id="FNanchor_29_29"/><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
has led some writers to suppose that he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir
John Pryor, and widow of Thomas Williams, a Welsh gentleman; but a letter to
Cromwell from one Harry Wykys of Thorpe, near Chertsey, dated November 2,
1523<a id="FNanchor_30_30"/><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>,
disproves this theory, and corroborates the other. The most probable explanation of
the entry in the will is that Mercy Pryor married twice, and that she was the
mother of Elizabeth Wykys by her first husband<a id="FNanchor_31_31"/><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.
Cromwell’s wife was probably a woman of some property. He was exactly the sort
of man who would seek a wife with an eye to the financial advantages of the
match, and the theory that Elizabeth Wykys was rich fits in well with the
evidence that her mother was married a second time. Moreover Cromwell’s property
increased so fast during his years of service under Wolsey, that even his
notorious accessibility to bribes could not account for it, had it not been
augmented from some outside source.</p>

<p>Chapuys goes on to say that for some time after his marriage Cromwell kept
servants in his house, carrying on the business of his father-in-law; a statement
corroborated by his correspondence, which shows that he plied his trade
as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> a cloth and wool
merchant at least as late as 1524. There can be little doubt, however, that he
continued his business as a solicitor at the same time, for it would be
impossible to explain his sudden advance in legal prominence in the years 1520
to 1525, if he had not had long practice in the law beforehand. The strange
combination of employments in which Cromwell was engaged fitted in well with the
peculiar versatility of the man, and brought him into close contact with diverse
sorts of men, in diverse conditions of life. A more detailed account of his
career during the seven or eight years which followed his probable return to
England it is impossible to give, for between 1512 and 1520 there occurs another
extraordinary gap in the life of Thomas Cromwell, during which we do not possess
a single trustworthy contemporary record concerning him. In 1520 there is
certainly evidence that he was known to Wolsey, but precisely how or when his
connexion with the Cardinal began, it is impossible to tell.</p>

<p>The statement in the Dictionary of National Biography that Wolsey appointed
Cromwell collector of his revenues in 1514 is apparently unfounded<a id="FNanchor_32_32"/><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>,
and no reference is given for the assertion in Singer’s Cavendish<a id="FNanchor_33_33"/><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
that the Cardinal first met his future servant in France. Another unverified
story is that Lord Henry Percy, who had been an intimate of the Cardinal’s
household in his early years, borrowed money from Cromwell, and conceiving a high
opinion of his creditor, introduced him to Wolsey<a id="FNanchor_34_34"/><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>;
while Mr. Phillips informs us that Robert Cromwell (the son of Walter Cromwell’s
brother John), who was vicar of Battersea under the Cardinal, gave to his cousin
Thomas the stewardship of the archiepiscopal estate of York House, after Wolsey
had been made archbishop there. Though Mr. Phillips has again failed to cite his
authority for this last statement, it is but fair to say that the probabilities
are strongly in its favour: the theory that Cromwell owed his appointment as
Wolsey’s servant to his cousin Robert seems particularly plausible, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the latter was certainly well known to the Cardinal. It is possible that the
origin of the connexion had something to do with the young Marquis of Dorset,
who later became Cromwell’s patron. Wolsey had long been acquainted with the
Marquis; he had been the friend and tutor of his father when he was principal
of Magdalen School, and had been given the living of Limington in Somerset by a
still older member of the family in 1500<a id="FNanchor_35_35"/><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>.
The date of the origin of Cromwell’s connexion with Wolsey must remain as much a
matter of conjecture as its cause. It seems probable that those historians who
have placed it as far back as 1513 or 1514 have been at fault, for had Cromwell
entered the Cardinal’s service as early as that there would almost certainly have
been more entries in the State Papers to show it. As it is, we possess only one
piece of evidence in contemporary records to show that he was known to Wolsey
before October, 1520, and that is of such a nature that little reliance can be
placed on it. On the back of a letter, written in August, 1514, by the Abbot of
Winchcomb to Wolsey<a id="FNanchor_36_36"/><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>,
are some lines in a hand which bears some resemblance to Cromwell’s, apparently
intended as an exercise in penmanship; the similarity of the handwritings,
however, is not so striking that it can be regarded as affording any very
conclusive proof: moreover as the words on the back have no connexion with the
letter itself, it is quite likely that they were written at a much later date.
It is safe to say that the lack of information on the subject in the State
Papers makes it probable that if Cromwell’s connexion with Wolsey began much
before 1520, it was certainly of very minor importance.</p>

<p>In the autumn of that year, however, we possess a record which leaves little
doubt that Cromwell had at least become known to the Cardinal. An appeal had been
made to the Papal Court at Rome against the sentence of the Prerogative Court of
Canterbury, in a suit between the vicar of Cheshunt and the Prioress of the
nunnery there. Wolsey, as Papal Legate, soon afterwards received a copy of the
citation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> inhibition
‘with other information by the letters of Thomas Cromwell,’ making clear the
rights and wrongs of the case, and the best method of handling it<a id="FNanchor_37_37"/><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.
No other mention of Cromwell in connexion with the Cardinal occurs until 1523,
when he drafted a petition to Wolsey in Chancery for a certain John Palsgrave<a id="FNanchor_38_38"/><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>.
But these two records are enough to prove that he was known to the Cardinal in
the capacity of a solicitor and clerk from a period at least as early as 1520.
The gap between that date and 1512 is more difficult to fill. The supposition
that Cromwell was in Wolsey’s service as early as 1513 is perhaps the easiest
method of disposing of these years, but it certainly cannot be regarded as more
than a theory, unless some new document is found which corroborates it.</p>

<p>Most of the letters addressed to Cromwell during this period from 1520 to 1524
concern themselves with legal business, and request his aid as a practised lawyer
in some suit for the collection of debts or the decision of a title to lands<a id="FNanchor_39_39"/><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.
In August, 1522, he acted as an ‘indifferent person’ in a dispute between
Richard Chauffer, alderman of Calais, and Lord Mountjoy. In December, 1523, he
served on the inquest of wardmote in the ward of Bread Street. But it is also
evident from his correspondence that he had by no means lost interest in his
business as a cloth merchant and wool-dyer<a id="FNanchor_40_40"/><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.
It may have been in this capacity that he first became known to the family of
the Marquis of Dorset. The ‘old lady Marques’ writes to him in August, 1522, as
her ‘sonne marquys s<i>er</i>v<i>au</i>nt,’ and desires him to send in haste
‘the trussynn bed of cloth of tyssewe and the fether bed wyth the fustyons, and
amateras longyng to the same wyth the cownterpoynt <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> tentes pauylyons &amp;
hales<a id="FNanchor_41_41"/><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>.’
There is also record that Cromwell was a great lender of money at high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
rates of interest. His friendship and reputation with foreign merchants brought
him an enormous amount of business, and his property increased to a great extent.
 The training he received during and after his journey on the Continent was
probably the best that he could have had to fit him for the difficult life-work
that was given him to perform. The spirit of the Italy of Machiavelli and Caesar
Borgia stamped itself deeply upon his youthful character. It gave him his ideas,
his theories. The hard school of adversity (at first almost a struggle for
existence), through which he passed during his early years, afforded him the
intimate knowledge of men and things, the wonderful insight into human nature,
and the ability to turn every event to the advancement of his own purposes, that
enabled him at a later day to mould the destinies of the English nation.</p>

<h4>NOVELLA XXXIV DELLA SECONDA PARTE DE LE NOVELLE
DEL BANDELLO, Tomo quinto, p. 251.</h4>

<p class="outdent">‘Francesco Frescobaldi fa cortesia ad uno straniero, e n’è
ben rimeritato, essendo colui divenuto Contestabile d’Inghilterra.’</p>

<p>‘Ne la famiglia nobile et antica de i Frescobaldi in Firenze fu, non sono
molti anni, un Francesco, mercadante molto leale et onorevole, il quale, secondo
la costuma de la patria, essendo assai ricco, trafficava in diversi luoghi e
faceva di gran faccende, e quasi per l’ordinario dimorava in Ponente, in
Inghilterra, e teneva la stanza in Londra, ove viveva splendidissimamente et
usava cortesia assai; non la veggendo sì per minuto come molti mercadanti fanno,
che la contano fin a un picciolo quattrino, come intendo dire che fa Ansaldo
Grimaldo Genovese, che tien conto fin d’un minimo foglio di carta e d’un palmo
di cordella da legar i pacchetti de le lettere. Avvenne un giorno che essendo
Francesco Frescobaldi in Firenze, se gli parò dinanzi un povero giovine, e gli
domandò elemosina per l’amor di Dio. Veggendolo il Frescobaldo sì mal in arnese
e che in viso mostrava aver del gentile, si mosse in pietà, e tanto più, quanto
che lo conobbe esser Inglese; onde gli domandò di che contrada di Oltramontani
fosse. Egli gli rispose che era Inglese; e chiedendogli alcune particolarità,
il Frescobaldo, d’Inghilterra, come colui che assai pratico n’era, il giovine
molto accomodatamente al tutto sodisfece, dicendogli: Io mi chiamo Tomaso<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Cremonello, figliuolo di un povero cimatore di panni, che fuggendo da mio padre
son venuto in Italia col campo de i Francesi, che è stato rotto al Garigliano,
e stavo con un fante a piedi, portandoli dietro la picca. Il Frescobaldo la menò
in casa molto domesticamente, e quivi alcun dì se lo tenne per amor de la
nazione Inglese, de la quale egli aveva ricevuti di molti piaceri; lo trattò
umanamente, lo vestì, e quando volse partirsi per ritornar ne la patria, gli
diede sedici ducati d’oro in oro fiorentini et un buon ronzino. Il giovine
veggendosi esser stato messo in arnese sì bene, rese al Frescobaldo quelle
grazie che seppe le maggiori, e se n’andò ne l’isola a casa.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>[The next four pages are devoted to a more or less accurate account of
Cromwell’s life in London, his connexion with Wolsey, and his entrance into the
King’s service. The events narrated in the following passage may be supposed to
have taken place about 1535 or 1536.]</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="nowrap">. . .</span> ‘Dico adunque che in quei dì che il Cremonello era padrone e governatore
de l’isola, che Francesco Frescobaldo si ritrovava in Italia, ove, come spesso a
mercadanti interviene, avendo patiti molti disastri e di gran danni ne la perdita
de le sue mercadanzie, restò molto povero; perciò che essendo uomo leale e da bene,
pagò tutti quelli a cui era debitore, e non puotè ricuperar ciò che da gli altri
gli era dovuto. Veggendosi egli ridutto a così povero stato, e fatto i suoi conti
e benissimo calculati, trovò che in Inghilterra aveva crediti per più di quindici
migliaia di ducati; onde si deliberò passar quindi, e veder di ricuperar più che
gli fosse possibile, e mettersi a viver il rimanente de la sua vita quietamente.
Così con questo pensiero passò d’Italia in Francia, e di Francia in Inghilterra,
e si fermò in Londra, non gli sovvenendo perciò mai del beneficio che egli fatto
già in Firenze aveva al Cremonello; cosa veramente degna d’un vero liberale, che
de le cortesie che altrui fa, memoria mai non tiene, scolpendo in marmo quelle che
riceve, per pagarle ogni volta che l’occasione se gli offerisce. Attendendo adunque
in Londra a negoziar i fatti suoi, e caminando un giorno in una contrada, avvenne
che il Contestabile passava anch’egli per la strada medesima, venendo a l’incontro
del Frescobaldo. Così subito che il Contestabile lo vide e gli ebbe gli occhi fermati
nel viso, si ricordò costui certamente esser quello, dal quale così gran cortesia
aveva in Firenze ricevuta, et essendo a cavallo, dismontò, e con meraviglia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
grandissima di quelli che seco erano, chi v’erano più di cento a cavallo de i primi
del regno che gli facevano coda, l’abbracciò con grande amorevolezza, e quasi lagrimando
gli disse: Non sete voi Francesco Frescobaldo Fiorentino? Sì sono, signor mio, rispose
egli, e vostro umil servidore. Mio servidore, disse il Contestabile, non sete già
voi nè per tal vi voglio, ma bene per mio grande amico, avvisandovi che di voi ho
giusta ragione di molto dolermi, perchè sapendo voi ciò che io sono e dove era,
devevate farmi saper la venuta vostra qui; che certamente io averei pagato qualche
parte del debito che confesso aver con voi. Ora lodato Iddio che ancor sono a tempo;
voi siate il benissimo venuto. Io vado ora per affari del mio Re, e non posso far
più lunga dimora vosco, e m’averete per iscusato; ma fate per ogni modo, che in
questa mattina vegnate a desinar meco, e non fate fallo. Così rimontò il Contestabile
a cavallo e se n’andò in Corte al Re. Il Frescobaldo, partito che fu il Contestabile,
s’andò ricordando che cotestui era quel giovine Inglese che egli già in Firenze
in casa sua raccolse, e cominciò a sperar bene, pensando che il mezzo di così grand’uomo
molto gli giovarebbe a ricuperar i suoi danari. Essendo poi l’ora di desinare, se
n’andò al palazzo del Contestabile, e quivi nel cortile poco attese che egli rivenne.
Il quale smontato che fu, di nuovo amicabilmente riabbracciò il Frescobaldo, e volto
a l’armiraglio, et ad altri prencipi e signori che con lui erano venuti a desinare,
disse: Signori, non vi meravigliate de le amorevoli dimostrazioni che io faccio a
questo gentiluomo Fiorentino, perchè queste sono parte di pagamento d’infiniti
obblighi che io conosco e confesso di avergli, essendo nel grado che sono per mezzo
suo, et udite come. A l’ora, a la presenza di tutti, tenendo sempre per mano il gentiluomo
Fiorentino, narrò loro in che modo era capitato a Firenze, e le carezze che da lui
aveva ricevute; e così tenendolo sempre per mano, se ne salirono le scale, e giunti
in sala si misero a tavola. Volle il Contestabile che il Frescobaldo gli stesse
appresso, e sempre l’accarezzò amorevolissimamente. Desinato che si fu e quei signori
partiti, volle il Contestabile saper la cagione, per la quale era il Frescobaldo
ritornato a Londra. Narrogli a l’ora tutta la sua disgrazia il Frescobaldo, e
che non gli essendo rimaso, de la casa in fuori in Firenze et un podere in
contado, quasi niente, se non quei quindeci mila ducati che in Inghilterra
deveva avere, e forse duo mila in Ispagna, che per ricuperargli s’era ne l’Isola
trasferito. Or bene sta, disse il Contestabile. A le cose passate, che fatte non
sieno, non si può trovar rimedio; ben mi posso con voi dolere de gl’infortunii
vostri, come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> con il core
faccio; al rimanente si darà tal ordine, che voi ricuperarete tutti i vostri
danari che qui devete avere, e non vi si mancherà di quello che io potrò,
assicurandovi, che la cortesia che m’usate, non mi conoscendo altramente, mi vi
rende di modo ubbligato che sempre sarò vostro, e di me e de le mie facultà
potrete disporre come io proprio, e non lo facendo, il danno sarà vostro, nè più
 farò offerta alcuna, parendomi che sarebbe superflua. Basti che questo vi sia
ora per sempre detto. Ma leviamoci et andiamo in camera, ove il Contestabile
serrato l’uscio, aperse un gran coffano pieno di ducati, e pigliandone sedeci
gli diede al Frescobaldi, e gli disse: Eccovi, amico mio, i sedeci ducati che mi
donaste al partir di Firenze, eccovi gli altri dieci che vi costò il ronzino che
per me comperaste, et eccovene altri dieci che spendeste in vestirmi. Ma perchè
essendo voi mercadante, non mi par onesto che i vostri danari debbiano esser
stati tanto tempo morti, ma s’abbiano guadagnato, come è il costume vostro,
eccovi quattro sacchetti di ducati, in ciascuno de i quali sono quattro mila
ducati. Voi in ricompensa de i vostri ve gli pigliarete, godendogli per amor
mio. Il Frescobaldo, ancor che da grandissime ricchezze fosse caduto in gran
povertà, nondimeno non aveva perduto la sua generosità d’animo, e non gli voleva
accettare, ringraziandolo tutta via di tanta sua cortesia; ma a la fine astretto
per viva forza dal Contestabile, che gli desse tutti i nomi in nota de i suoi
debitori; il che Frescobaldo fece molto volentieri, mettendo il nome dei debitori
e la somma che gli devevano. Avuta questa cedula, chiamò il Cremonello un suo
uomo di casa, e gli disse: Guarda chi sono costoro, che su questa lista sono
scritti, e fa che gli ritrovi tutti, siano dove si vogliano in questa isola, e
farai loro intendere che se fra quindici giorni non hanno pagato tutto il lor
debito, che io ci porrò la mano con lor dispiacere e danno, e che facciano
pensiero, che io sia il creditore. Fece l’uomo il comandamento del suo padrone
molto diligentemente, di maniera che al termine statuito furono ricuperati circa
quindici mila ducati. E se il Frescobaldo avesse voluto gl’interessi, che in
così lungo tempo erano corsi, tutti gli averebbe avuti, fin ad un minimo denaio;
ma egli si contentò del capitale, nè volse interesse alcuno, che di più in più
gli acquistò credito e riputazione appresso tutti, massimamente sapendosi già
da ciascuno de l’isola il favore che egli aveva appresso la persona del
Contestabile. In questo mezzo, fu di continovo esso Frescobaldo commensale del
Cremonello, il quale di giorno in giorno si sforzava d’onorarlo quanto più
poteva. E desiderando che di continovo egli rimanesse in Londra, piacendogli
molto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> la pratica sua, gli
offerse di prestargli per quattro anni sessanta mila ducati, a ciò che mettesse
casa e banco in Londra e gli trafficasse, senza volerne profitto d’un soldo,
promettendogli oltra questo ogni favore ne le cose de la mercadanzia. Ma il
Frescobaldo che desiderava di ritirarsi a casa, e viver il resto de la sua vita
in quiete et attender solamente a se stesso, infinitamente lo ringraziò di
tanta suprema cortesia, e con buona grazia del Contestabile, rimessi tutti i
suoi danari in Firenze, a la desiderata patria se ne ritornò, dove essendo
ritornato assai ricco, si mise a viver una vita quietissima. Ma poco tempo visse
in quiete, perchè quell’anno istesso che da Londra era partito, in Firenze se
ne morì.’</p>

<h4>PASSAGES FROM THE LIFE OF LORD CROMWELL AS CONTAINED IN
FOXE’S ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY, vol. ii. pp. 419–434.</h4>

<p>‘Thomas Cromwell although born of a simple Parentage and House obscure,
through the singular excellency of Wisdom and dexterity of Wit wrought in him by
God, coupled with like industry of mind, and deserts of life, rose to high
preferment and authority;’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘First as touching his Birth, he was born at Putney or thereabout, being a
Smiths Son, whose Mother married after to a sheerman.’</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>‘As touching the order and manner of his coming up, it would be superfluous
to discourse what may be said at large: only by way of story it may suffice to
give a touch of certain particulars and so to proceed.’ <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> ‘Nothing was so
hard which with wit and industery he could not compass. Neither was his capacity
so good but his memory was as great in retaining whatsoever he had attained.
Which well appeareth in canning the text of the whole new Testament of Erasmus
Translation without Book, in his journey going and coming from Rome, whereof you
shall hear anon.’</p>

<p>‘Thus in his growing years, as he shot up in age and ripeness, a great delight
 came in his mind to stray into forreign Countries to see the World abroad, and
to learn experience, whereby he learned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
such Tongues and Languages as might better serve for his use hereafter.’</p>

<p>‘And thus passing over his youth being at Antwerp, he was there retained of
the English Merchants to be their Clerk or Secretary, or in some such like
condition placed pertaining to their affairs.’</p>

<p>‘It happened the same time that the Town of Boston thought good to send up to
Rome for renewing of their two pardons, one called the great pardon and the other
the lesser pardon. Which thing although it should stand them in great expences
of money (for the Popes Merchandise is always dear ware) yet notwithstanding
such sweetness they had felt thereof, and such gain to come to their town by
that Romish Merchandise (as all Superstition is commonly gainful) that they like
good Catholick Merchants and the Popes good customers, thought to spare for no
cost, to have their leases again of their pardons renewed, whatsoever they paid
for the fine. And yet was all this good Religion then, such was the lamentable
blindness of that time.’</p>

<p>‘This then being so determined and decreed among my Countrymen of Boston to
have their pardons needs repaired and renewed from Rome, one Geffery Chambers,
with another Champion was sent for the messengers, with writings and money, no
small quantity, well furnished, and with all other things appointed necessary
for so chargeable and costly exploit. Who coming in his journey to Antwerp, and
misdoubting to be too weak for the compassing of such a weighty piece of work,
conferred and perswaded with T. Cromwel to associat him in that legacy, and to
assist him in the contriving thereof. Cromwel although perceiving the enterprise
to be of no small difficulty to traverse the Popes Court, for the unreasonable
expences amongst those greedy Cormorants, yet having some skill of the Italian
Tongue, and as yet not grounded in the judgement of Religion in those his youthful
days, was at length obtained and content to give the adventure, and so took his
journey towards Rome. Cromwel loth to spend much time, and more loth to spend
his money; and again perceiving that the Popes greedy humour must needs be served
with some present or other (for without rewards there is no doing at Rome) began
to cast with himself what thing best to devise wherein he might best serve the
Popes devotion.’</p>

<p>‘At length having knowledge how that the Popes holy tooth greatly delighted
to new fangled strange delicates and dainty dishes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it came in his mind to prepare certain fine dishes of gelly, after the best
fashion, made after our Countrey manner here in England, which to them of Rome
was not known nor seen before.’</p>

<p>‘This done, Cromwell observing his time accordingly, as the Pope was newly
come from hunting into his pavillion, he with his companions approached with his
English presents brought in with a three mans song (as we call it) in the English
tongue and after the English fashion. The Pope suddenly marvelling at the
strangeness of the song, and understanding that they were English men, and that
they came not empty handed, willed them to be called in. Cromwel there shewing
his obedience, and offering his jolly junkets, such as Kings and Princes only,
said he, in the Realm of England use to feed upon, desired the same to be
accepted in benevolent part, which he and his companions, as poor suters unto
his Holiness had there brought and presented, as novelties meet for his
recreation etc.’</p>

<p>‘Pope Julius, seeing the strangeness of the dishes, commanded by and by his
Cardinal to take the assay. Who in tasting thereof liked it so well, and so
likewise the Pope after him, that knowing of them what their sutes were, and
riquiring them to make known the making of that meat, he incontinent, without
any more adoe, stamped both their pardons as well the greater as the lesser: <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> it
seemeth that Cromwell obtained this Pardon aforesaid about the year of our Lord,
<span class="nowrap">1510.’. . .</span></p>

<p>[The rest of the story deals for the most part with Cromwell’s career in the
service of the Cardinal and of the King. Historically it is almost worthless—nearly
every paragraph contains statements which the more trustworthy sources prove to
be impossible. A curious legend of Cromwell’s saving the life of the Earl of
Bedford at Bologna is followed by a more plausible account of the latter
afterward commending his preserver to the King. Foxe also states that Sir
Christopher Hales, a violent papist, but a friend of Cromwell’s, took an
opportunity to say a good word for him to Henry after Wolsey’s fall, that the
King at last had an interview with his future minister in Westminster Gardens,
and was advised by him to shake off the yoke of Rome. The latter part of this
story follows closely the account of Cardinal Pole (see chapter vi. p. 92). Foxe
goes on to an exhaustive defence of Cromwell’s actions during his ministry,
especially the suppression of the monasteries and the measures adopted for the
promotion of the new religion. The story of the loss of Cranmer’s Book Against
the Six Articles at the bear-baiting on the Thames (see chapter xiii. p. 255)
and the account<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> of
Frescobaldo’s kindness to Cromwell in Florence are related at length. Many other
minor incidents of Cromwell’s life are also recorded: we are told how he stopped
a skirmish in Paternoster Row, how he prevented a friar from wearing his cowl in
the streets, how he imprisoned a ruffian with long hair, and how he aided a poor
man whose father had once befriended him in distress. The story closes with an
account of Cromwell’s fall, sentence and execution, and gives the speech and
prayer he is supposed to have made on the scaffold. (See <a href="#Page_303">Appendix</a> at the end of chapter xiv.)]</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE PARLIAMENT OF 1523</p>

<p>The heavy veil that shrouds in mystery the early life of Thomas Cromwell is
not completely lifted until after he becomes counsellor to the King, but even
before and during his service with Wolsey, we catch several interesting glimpses
of him. Especially important is the information we possess concerning the part
he played in the Parliament of 1523. We have no means of knowing how he obtained
a seat there, but there are fortunately preserved two documents of undoubted
authenticity that shed much light on the attitude he assumed towards the problems
which came up for discussion. The first is a speech which exists to-day at the
Public Record Office in the hand of one of Cromwell’s clerks, and contains a
distinct and careful enunciation of the policy which the future minister
actually pursued in after years. The second is a letter from Cromwell to a
friend, John Creke, in Biscay, in which he tells how he ‘amongyst other indured
a parlyament<a id="FNanchor_46_46"/><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.’
This epistle is in itself an excellent index to the character and political
ideals of its author. Cromwell’s ill-concealed contempt for the vague discussions
and fruitless arguments of the Commons, who finally in disgust left off where
they began, his evident disappointment that the ‘right large subsydye’ had been
granted in spite of his disapproval, and his sneering statement that this
Parliament had failed as signally as its predecessors had, to do anything of
real practical value to King or realm, but had wasted its time in foolish
theorizing and useless debate—all are perfectly consistent with the characteristics
revealed by his later policy and actions.</p>

<p>In order to understand the speech which Cromwell wrote to deliver in this
Parliament, a preliminary survey of some of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the business that lay before the House may be helpful. The period immediately
previous to the session of 1523 had been occupied by Henry and Wolsey in sending
messages to the powerful and traitorous Duke of Bourbon, to obtain from him a
recognition of the King’s title to the throne of France. The breach between
<a id="francis"/><a href="#francis"></a>England and France was becoming wider every day. Charles V. had of course
seized the favourable opportunity to ally himself with Bourbon and Henry, and
had as usual succeeded in making the latter do the lion’s share of the work, and
pay practically all the bills. Loans to the Emperor and to the Duke, and the
expense of keeping up the defences in the north, where Scotland daily threatened
to break out into open war, had drained the country’s resources to their lowest ebb.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Henry thought it fit to summon a Parliament, the
first since December, 1515. The policy of Wolsey, in regard to the great
legislative body of the kingdom, had up to this time been very closely followed.
He had not reached the point which Cromwell at a later day was destined to
attain; that is, he had not so completely obtained the upper hand of the Commons
that he could use them as a tool to accomplish his will. He rather regarded
Parliament as a dangerous power to be suppressed at all costs, than as a means
to attain his own ends. Consequently it had not met for nearly eight years. But
the present crisis was one which called for more than the ordinary resources of
the nation; nothing could be accomplished against France unless an enormous
subsidy was granted; that subsidy could only be granted by Parliament, and
Wolsey, rather unwillingly, was forced to consent to the King’s summoning it,
relying on Henry’s great personal popularity, and the peculiarly bitter national
hatred of France, to make it accomplish for him what he could not do for himself<a id="FNanchor_47_47"/><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas More was chosen Speaker, probably because of his high favour with
Henry, who did not scruple to give Parliament broad hints of his pleasure in
all matters in which he was interested, and though, as Roper says,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
More was ‘very loath to take this room upon him<a id="FNanchor_48_48"/><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>,’
yet the King would not consent to his resignation. And the story goes on to
tell how Wolsey ‘found himself much grieved with the burgesses of this
Parliament, for that nothing was so soon done or spoken therein but that it was
immediately blown abroad in every ale-house<a id="FNanchor_49_49"/><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>,’
and how, fearing that the subsidy bill might not pass, he determined to be
present at the debate himself, and was received, at Sir Thomas More’s suggestion,
‘with all his pomp, with his maces, his pillars, his poleaxes, his crosses, his
hat, and his great seal too.’ But Wolsey need not have been so anxious about the
passage of his bill. Though at first the House would not deign to consider the
subsidy in his presence, alleging that ‘there was not so much money out of the
King’s hands in the whole realm,’ it had been out of practice too long to realize
its own power, and after a great deal of haggling and fruitless endeavours by
the members to beg off for less than the £800,000 at first demanded, Wolsey
carried his point<a id="FNanchor_50_50"/><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>,
and by the end of June was able to announce to Henry that there was no further
hindrance to the proposed invasion of France.</p>

<p>While the debate was in progress, however, Cromwell was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
one of the strongest opponents of the Cardinal’s scheme. The following speech,
which he wrote to deliver on this occasion<a id="FNanchor_51_51"/><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>,
clearly reveals his attitude on the questions before the House.</p>

<p>‘To recou<i>er</i> agayne by the sworde the Realme of Fraunce, belongyng to o<i>ur</i>

most redowtyd souuerayn prosperous Succession and fortunat atcheuyng of all this
his noble entrepryse.’</p>

<p>There is no record that this speech was ever delivered; even if it was, it
certainly had no effect in this unwieldy and unpractical session of Parliament.
But the accuracy and force of the speaker’s reasoning were destined to be proved
by the subsequent course of events. For the student of the present day, who is
enabled to glance at the whole picture from a distance, so that the various facts
assume more or less their proper proportion and perspective, Cromwell’s words on
this occasion will always remain as one of the strongest proofs of his political
wisdom and foresight.</p>

<p>After touching on the subject of the war, and assuring the House of his
conviction that any one present would give goods and life ten thousand times over
to recover France for the King (a shrewd beginning, for if Henry was not present
in person, no one knew better than Cromwell how accurately every word spoken in
the Parliament would be reported to him, and how important it was for one who
would gain the royal favour to put his loyalty to the Crown first of all), he
goes on, after a few commonplace remarks about the war’s being waged with energy,
to crave the pardon of the House for addressing so noble an assembly. This preface
is eminently characteristic of the speaker. When not perfectly certain of his
ground, and in the presence of those whom he wished to conciliate, none could be
a more adroit flatterer than he; it was only when he was completely master of the
situation (and he had a peculiar gift of discovering just what his position was
in relation to other people) that he became contemptuous, overbearing, and cruel.</p>

<p>But not even yet had he said enough to prove his loyalty to the King. He
agrees that war is inevitable, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
question now is how it may be most effectually carried on, but when he foresees
that the King will go in person, he is greatly distressed. He talks loudly about
the danger of the King being killed, hints that Henry possessed a courage and a
self-sacrifice to the interests of England which would render him impervious to
any argument about personal risk, and then launches himself into the heart of his
discourse. The King is an absolute necessity to the welfare and progress of the
State. If the King were removed, the country would probably be brought face to
face with the horrors of a civil war. Cromwell thus brings his hearers to the
first great principle of the policy that he was destined later to pursue, namely,
concentration of power in the hands of the Crown, as a <i>sine qua non</i> of
unity at home and safety abroad. This principle he enforces with many other
arguments. The danger from the hostility of Scotland was enormous; let the King
‘Reffrayne his high magnanyme Courage’ and remaining at home, so direct the
movements of his forces, that England and Scotland may together move as a unit.
France has bought off many who may seem to be England’s allies on the Continent.
The consequence of an invasion of France would be the scattering of the army; it
might be cut off in an attempt to capture Paris, and England would be left to the
mercy of its first invader. The country must make sure of its own safety, before
entering upon a war of aggression.</p>

<p>He brings up other points to prove his case, and here speaks against the
proposed subsidy. He saw, as a merchant, that the amount proposed was excessive;
his fear was that all the coin and bullion in the realm would be exhausted by
three summers of fruitless warring, so that the nation would be forced ‘to koyne
lether agayne,’ as it had done once before. His appreciation of the importance of
sound finance, and the evils of a depreciated currency show a knowledge of economic
principles far in advance of his time. ‘Yf yt showld fortune o<i>ur</i> most
Redowtyd Souerayne, yf he wold nyedys go ou<i>er</i> yn hys owne p<i>er</i>sone
to happyn by any adu<i>er</i>se fortune, whiche almyghty god defend to cum into
the hand<i>es</i> of o<i>ur</i> enemyes,’ says Cromwell, ‘how shuld we then be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hable to Redeme hym agayne yf they wyll nought for their wynes but golde they
wold thynck grete skorne, to take lether for o<i>ur</i> prynce.’ Cromwell had
early learned the lesson that money and brains were rapidly becoming far more
important factors in winning battles, than mere superiority in brute strength or
numbers. In his ingenious argument against the subsidy, he had pleaded the cause
of the poor people, on whom the taxes fell most heavily, and had at the same time
avoided arousing the opposition of the other party, by his adroit flattery at the
outset.</p>

<p>His appreciation of the increased difficulty of waging war abroad compared
with that in previous ages, because of lack of bases of supplies and friendly
towns on the Continent, which before had been numerous, betokens great foresight
and knowledge of details. Though he expressly declares, at the beginning of his
speech, his intention to leave to ‘sage persons’ the task of deciding how the war
should be carried on, he hints that it would be better to play a waiting game and
weary the French, while things were consolidated at home, than to try to conquer
France by invasion. His attitude about Scotland is repeated with great vigour at
the close of his speech. For the King to unify England and Scotland would secure
him greater honour than his predecessors had ever attained, and would in the end
prove a much more telling blow against France, than a direct invasion. The question
of gaining possessions across the sea is of secondary importance: the first thing
is to obtain control of a country which belongs to the same island.</p>

<p>Thus Cromwell succeeded in clearly enunciating the main principles of the
policy by which he was so soon to guide the affairs of England, while he so
flattered King, nobles, and people, that he made many friends, and avoided the
enmity of those opposed to him. The man who could make such a speech as this,
would not be likely to escape the notice of such an astute man as Henry VIII. It
was probably within the walls of this Parliament, that Cromwell laid the first
stone of his future greatness as servant and counsellor of the King.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">WOLSEY’S SERVANT</p>

<p>After the year 1524, there is no further mention of Thomas Cromwell as the
cloth-merchant and wool-dyer. He probably realized that his business as a lawyer
brought him into much more prominence as a public man, but his term in Parliament
doubtless aroused in him a desire for even greater things than the life of a
successful solicitor. His advance in legal prominence, however, is marked by his
admittance in 1524 as a member of Gray’s Inn, and by his appointment in the same
year as one of the Subsidy Commissioners for the Hundred of Ossulton in
Middlesex<a id="FNanchor_62_62"/><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>;
but such petty distinctions fade into the background in the face of a matter of
far more absorbing interest, that is, his rapidly growing favour and intimacy
with Cardinal Wolsey.</p>

<p>During the years 1524–1525 he was actively engaged in the Cardinal’s service,
and received many letters on legal business which he transacted for his
master<a id="FNanchor_63_63"/><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>.
Seekers for Wolsey’s mercy or patronage invariably came to him, as a likely means
of getting their wishes granted. In several cases requests to the Cardinal are
addressed directly to the ‘right worshipful Mr. Cromwell.’ It is evident from the
tone of the letters which he received, that to obtain his favour was the first
and most important step towards gaining that of his master. He was usually spoken
of as ‘Councillor to my Lord Legate,’ and was pre-eminent above all the rest of
Wolsey’s advisers. It has been thought by some that the Cardinal employed him in
connexion with his political schemes, but this is an error. Cromwell began
modestly, as befitted his lowly birth and humble origin, and at this time, at any
rate, was employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> merely as
an agent, chosen for his wonderful knowledge of human nature and his great
capacity for business.</p>

<p>In the beginning of 1525, however, Wolsey felt that he had in Cromwell a
servant sufficiently capable to be trusted with the performance of a work which
was nearest the Cardinal’s heart, namely the destruction of some of the smaller
monasteries to furnish funds for the building of his college at Oxford. So on the
4th of January of that year, he commissioned Sir William Gascoigne, William
Burbank, and Thomas Cromwell, to survey the monasteries of Tykford, Raveneston,
Poghley, Medmenham, Wallingford, and Fynchingbroke and their possessions, and on
the same day he appointed Thomas Cromwell and John Smyth as attorneys for the
site and circuit of Thoby, Blakamore, Stanesgate, and Tiptree, which had been
granted to John Higden, Dean of Cardinal’s College<a id="FNanchor_64_64"/><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that Wolsey’s suppression of the smaller religious houses
brought him so much unpopularity. It was certainly true that the monasteries had
long since ceased to observe the strict traditions of religious asceticism, which
had been the watchword of their foundation. Some of them had become resorts of
the idle and worthless, who were permitted by supine or indulgent superiors to
exchange a life of monastic discipline for one of luxury and indolence, if not of
downright vice. But there were a few, seemingly unimportant facts, which outweighed
all these charges. In the first place the monks were the easiest of landlords. In
their practically defenceless state, it was surely for their advantage to
conciliate their fellow men in every way, and to avoid disputes at any cost. They
consequently suffered themselves to be imposed upon by their neighbours and
tenants, in preference to risking their popularity by asserting themselves. So
Wolsey’s measures, which brought in stricter landlords, increased rents, and did
away with the good old slipshod management of so many years’ standing, met with
ill-concealed dislike. The monks, moreover, were the most hospitable of people;
the poor were never turned away unfed, the traveller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
could always find shelter beneath their roof, and this fact, coupled with the
rooted opposition of the less educated class to any sweeping measure of reform
adopted apparently without reason, while the old system appeared to all intents
and purposes to work well, explained the rest. Wolsey’s measures to suppress the
smaller monasteries, and confiscate their possessions to the use of his own
colleges, may justly be described as universally unpopular<a id="FNanchor_65_65"/><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p>The first requisites for the accomplishment of such a design as the suppression
of the monasteries were an intimate knowledge of law, especially as related to
lands and property, and a far-seeing, harsh, and rather unscrupulous nature. These
qualities Cromwell possessed in the very highest degree, and as he had been
eminently successful in carrying on all Wolsey’s legal business up to this time,
and as the Cardinal was too busy with his foreign policy to give his own attention
to this favourite scheme, it is no wonder that he chose Cromwell to supervise it
for him. The work consisted in surveying and estimating the value of the property
of the condemned monasteries, making careful inventories thereof, and finally in
stripping them of all their transportable riches, which usually meant altars,
furnishings, bells, and tapestry, while their lands and permanent possessions
were sold or leased on the spot. The transfer of property, settlements with
tenants, and adjustment of claims were a task of far greater intricacy than Wolsey
had expected, and Cromwell’s success in carrying it out was little short of
marvellous. He was usually present in person at the surrenders and dissolutions;
when this was impossible one of his many and faithful agents sent him an exact
account of the proceedings in his absence. The number of monks and nuns that were
suddenly turned out upon the world with small and irregularly paid pensions was
not the least evil feature of the ruthless way in which the suppressions were
carried on; but it was nothing to what was to follow a decade later<a id="FNanchor_66_66"/><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to surveying and confiscating monastic property,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Cromwell was employed directly in connexion with the new buildings at Oxford and
Ipswich. He drew up all the necessary deeds for both foundations, and was appointed
receiver-general of Cardinal’s College by Wolsey in 1527. He kept account of all
the incomes from the suppressed houses and all the expenses incident to the
building of both colleges. He was continually superintending the workmen at Oxford
and Ipswich, and reported their progress to his master. The Dean of the college at
Ipswich wrote to the Cardinal, Sept. 26, 1528, how Cromwell came thither with
copes, vestments, and plate, and took great pains to see all the stuff carried in
safely, and to prepare hangings and benches for the Hall. Long lists of the manors
and monasteries, the incomes of which were devoted to the building and establishment
of the two colleges, are to be seen to-day at the Record Office, and attest the
gigantic amount of labour that he performed<a id="FNanchor_67_67"/><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s efficiency in carrying on this work was only equalled by his
notorious accessibility to bribes and presents in the disposal of monastic leases.
Adding to this the fact that the measure was radically unpopular in itself, and
that when no bribes were offered, Cromwell and most of Wolsey’s other agents were
harsh and overbearing in the extreme, the reader ceases to wonder at the outburst
of popular indignation. The minute Wolsey’s back was turned Cromwell and his
companion Dr. Alen, a hard and grasping man equally well trained in business,
proceeded to use the power given into their hands to enrich themselves by every
possible means, some of which were utterly unjustifiable. The monastery which
could pay a large bribe was often left untouched; of those that were suppressed,
probably a certain proportion of the spoils was never employed at Oxford or
Ipswich, but went straight into the pockets of the suppressors<a id="FNanchor_68_68"/><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.
Petitions to save farms for poor people, or to get benefices for those whose
property was gone, were answered by Cromwell favourably, if granting them meant a
substantial reward for him;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
unfavourably, if the reverse. He became so generally hated that in August, 1527,
it was said that a ‘sanctuary man’ lay in wait to slay him, and Cardinal Pole, who
was then in London and knew him well, informs us that it was commonly reported
that he had been sent to prison, and would be punished for his crimes as Wolsey’s
agent<a id="FNanchor_69_69"/><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p>

<p>But in spite of all this, instead of being removed from his important post,
Cromwell kept on rising to higher favour and more importance. In April, 1527,
Henry Lacy writes to congratulate him on his promotion through Wolsey’s favour.
In May of the same year he is mentioned as a granter of annuities. His position
brought him a great amount of patronage. In 1528 Richard Bellyssis promises him a
good gelding, if he will prefer a friend to the position of mint-master in Durham.
A merchant requests him to get his son a promotion from the Cardinal. He received
many petitions from poor men, who feared they would lose house and home through
the dissolution of the monastery from which they were held. But the noble and
great, as well as the lowly and humble, were his correspondents and suitors. The
Abbot of York writes his heartfelt thanks for his kindness in speaking well of him
and his monastery to Wolsey, and Lord Berners begs for his aid in his dealings
with the Cardinal<a id="FNanchor_70_70"/><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</p>

<p>By far the greater portion of Cromwell’s correspondence during the years 1525–1529
is connected with the suppression of the monasteries or the foundation of Wolsey’s
colleges. Reports and receipts of money from his agents who visited the religious
houses in various parts of the country at his orders, or who superintended the works
at Ipswich and Oxford, crowd in upon him with great frequency. Deeds of the sale
of castles and manors, valuations and inventories of the property of various monasteries,
are received by him in large numbers<a id="FNanchor_71_71"/><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.
In these letters we frequently meet with the names of William Brabazon and Ralph
Sadler, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> destined in
the near future to become so well known as his agents and commissioners when he
entered the King’s service. Before this period he had made the acquaintance of
Stephen Vaughan, his friend and correspondent in later years, who figured in
connexion with Tyndale in the Low Countries. Vaughan was certainly known to Cromwell
at least as early as 1523<a id="FNanchor_72_72"/><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>;
and in 1526 was employed by the Cardinal’s servant in connexion with the college
at Oxford. In April, 1527, we find Cromwell helping his friend in the recovery of
certain goods lost on the sea, and in the following year Vaughan addresses a
cordial letter to his benefactor, reporting various things of interest in London,
and announcing that he has found so strong a chain for the wicket of Cromwell’s
house at Austin Friars Gate, that it will be impossible for any one to enter by
force<a id="FNanchor_73_73"/><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>.
A year later he was employed as Cromwell’s agent in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Though mainly occupied with Wolsey’s affairs, Cromwell’s correspondence during
the years 1524–1529 shows that he still kept up his business as a lawyer independently.
William Bareth writes in November, 1525, that he trusts he will solicit his matter
to Mr. Rowe, and sends his wife six plovers ‘for to drynke a quart of wyn
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>all<a id="FNanchor_74_74"/><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>’;
in August, 1526, George Monoux, alderman, promises Cromwell that if his ‘grete
matier’ is brought to a safe conclusion, he shall have twenty marks<a id="FNanchor_75_75"/><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>.
A ‘lovyng l<i>ette</i>re’ from the Aldermen of our Lady’s Gild in Boston, in Dec.
1528, shows that Cromwell still retained the friendship which he probably made
years before by obtaining for them the indulgences from the Pope by the offer of
choice sweetmeats. It was doubtless through him that the Gild gained the privilege
of supplying rare and delicate fowls for the Cardinal’s sumptuous table<a id="FNanchor_76_76"/><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.
Cromwell also found time to correspond with Miles Coverdale, who was then at
Cambridge, and who writes with enthusiasm of the pleasures of a visit to his
friend in London<a id="FNanchor_77_77"/><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>.</p>

<p>It is probable that the terrible sweating sickness which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
ravaged England from 1527 to 1528 carried off Cromwell’s wife Elizabeth, as there
is no further mention of her in his later papers and correspondence, except in his
will of July, 1529, where she is referred to as his ‘late Wyff<a id="FNanchor_78_78"/><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>.’
She left him one son, Gregory, who appears to have been a dull and plodding lad,
and who, after his mother’s death, was sent with his very precocious cousin, Christopher
Wellyfed, and several other boys, to be put under the care of a tutor at Cambridge,
John Chekyng by name, whose correspondence with Cromwell about the progress of
‘his scolers’ is very interesting and entertaining<a id="FNanchor_79_79"/><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.
Chekyng seems at the very outset to have been unfavourably impressed with Gregory’s
talents, declares that he has been so badly taught that he could hardly conjugate
three verbs when committed to his care, and reports that he is now studying ‘the
things most conducive to the reading of authors,’ and spends the rest of the day
in forming letters; while Christopher does not require ‘much stirring up.’ A
little later he sends word that Gregory is getting on well in learning under his
care, and desires his father to send five yards of ‘marble frieze,’ for his winter
‘galberdyne’; and again, in 1530, he declares that he has been so successful in
his teaching, that Gregory will be ‘loadyd with Latyne’ before he comes home again;
but it is evident throughout that Chekyng considers every step in advance to have
been due to the excellence of his own tuition, rather than to the aptitude of his
pupil. If the tone of Gregory’s letters to his father be taken as a criterion of
the boy’s character, he must indeed have been stupid and slow beyond belief<a id="FNanchor_80_80"/><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>.
But Cromwell was too much occupied with his own affairs, to pay much attention to
the remarks of honest John Chekyng. Indeed there is reason to think that his
grasping disposition showed itself in small ways to such an extent that he did not
always pay the very moderate bills that the tutor sent in for Gregory’s board,
lodging, and tuition; but instead taunted Chekyng with not having done well with
his ‘folks.’ To these insults Chekyng replied that he had brought up six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
M.A.’s and fellows of colleges, and that the least Cromwell could do was to pay
for the furniture which his scholars had ruined; he then goes on to tell how
Christopher ‘dyd hynge a candel in a playt to loyk apone hys boyk and so fell
ascleype and the candell fell into the bed strawe’ and there were burnt the bed,
bolster, ‘three overleydes and a sparver<a id="FNanchor_81_81"/><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.’</p>

<p>In spite of his niggardly treatment of John Chekyng, it is certain that Cromwell
was in very comfortable circumstances during his years of service under Wolsey.
An inventory of his goods at his house at Austin Friars, dated June 26, 1527<a id="FNanchor_82_82"/><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>,
which exists to-day at the Public Record Office, proves that his dwelling was
furnished handsomely if not luxuriously, while a draft of his will, written July
12, 1529<a id="FNanchor_83_83"/><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
indicates that his property at that time was by no means inconsiderable. It is to
this document that we owe the greater part of our present information concerning
Cromwell’s family. It is written in the hand of Cromwell’s chief clerk, and was
altered at a later date by Cromwell himself<a id="FNanchor_84_84"/><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
The document is for the most part self-explanatory, but there are a few interesting
facts to be especially noted in connexion with it. The bequests to Cromwell’s
daughters ‘Anne and Grace’ and to his ‘litill Doughter Grace’ are our only proof
that he had other children than Gregory; and the fact that both these items were
crossed out after the year 1529 possibly indicates that the daughters died when
young. We also learn that Cromwell’s nephew Richard, the son of Katherine Cromwell
and Morgan Williams, had followed in his uncle’s footsteps, and was ‘s<i>er</i>u<i>au</i>nt
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> my lorde Marques Dorssett’ at the time that the will was first
composed; but he certainly received other employment soon afterwards, for the
name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> of his master was
scored through in the will by Cromwell at a later date, and we also know from
other sources that Richard Williams entered his uncle’s service and was active in
suppressing the monasteries and in subduing the Pilgrimage of Grace, during the
year 1536 and afterwards<a id="FNanchor_85_85"/><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>.
Before this date he had changed his name to Cromwell, and later became great-grandfather
to the Protector<a id="FNanchor_86_86"/><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>.
His mother died before 1529, for Cromwell in his will refers to Elizabeth Wellyfed
as his ‘onlye Suster.’ Cromwell’s wife, as we have already seen, had also died
before the will was made; her sister Joan married a certain John Williamson, an
old friend of Cromwell’s, who later figured prominently in the latter’s service.
We also meet with many of the other names mentioned in this will, in Cromwell’s
later correspondence. Nearly all the friends of his earlier days were employed by
him in one capacity or another as spies, agents, or even minor ambassadors to
foreign Courts, after he had entered the King’s service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE FALL OF THE CARDINAL</p>

<p>In October, 1529, Cardinal Wolsey lost the King’s favour, and fell into
disgrace. He was forced to give up the Great Seal, sign an indenture acknowledging
that he had incurred the guilt of Praemunire, forfeit most of his lands, possessions,
and offices, and retire to his seat at Esher<a id="FNanchor_142_142"/><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>.
His faithful biographer, Cavendish, gives a very touching account of the Cardinal’s
surrender of his goods, his removal from the scene of his labours, and his
enforced living in ‘estraunge estate<a id="FNanchor_143_143"/><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>.’
Few fallen ministers have ever been in a more pitiful position. To have incurred
the ill-will of his master, as he had done, meant certain ruin in those days; and
besides this he had turned the people against him by the part he had taken in the
divorce. Anne Boleyn, whose influence at the Court was at its height, detested him
for his failure to bring it about; the clergy and common people hated him for
attempting it. The few friends who retained their fidelity to him in his trouble
were prevented from showing it by their consciousness of the royal and popular
displeasure.</p>

<p>As Wolsey’s servant, counsellor, and friend, Cromwell naturally felt the
keenest anxiety lest he should be involved in his master’s ruin. It has been
already shown that his action in suppressing the monasteries had made him very
generally hated; and now that the prop that had supported him in his difficult and
unpopular task was gone, he had great need to look to himself, if he did not wish
to fall with the Cardinal. That he was perfectly well informed of the position in
which he was placed is proved by a letter which he received from his friend Stephen
Vaughan, written at Antwerp, October 30, 1529, which tells him that he is more
hated for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> his master’s sake
than for anything which he has wrongfully done to any man<a id="FNanchor_144_144"/><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>.
Another letter from his companion in Wolsey’s service, Sir Thomas Rush, who was
employed with him at Ipswich, gave him further warning of the evil reports that
were circulated about him<a id="FNanchor_145_145"/><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.
It is no wonder that he was seriously alarmed.</p>

<p>Modern investigation has made it certain that there is but little historical
foundation for the touching pictures drawn by Cavendish, Shakespeare, and, at a
later day, Froude, which represent Cromwell as the faithful servant of his fallen
master, unselfish, and exclusively devoted to his interests<a id="FNanchor_146_146"/><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>.
There is no reason to think that Cavendish, whose testimony is most valuable as
that of an eye-witness of the scenes he describes, wilfully distorted the facts,
but it is certain that his directness and simplicity often prevented him from
drawing just conclusions from them, when he had to do with such astute men as
Wolsey and Cromwell. By comparing his story with the events which followed, we
shall see that while Cromwell kept up the appearance of spending all his time in
helping Wolsey in his disgrace, he really was occupied in serving his own ends,
and in regaining the favour he had lost as the Cardinal’s agent. Though he carefully
abstained from doing or saying anything prejudicial to Wolsey’s cause, for fear
of alienating people by laying himself open to the accusation of faithlessness to
his master, he really did nothing to the Cardinal’s advantage that did not redound,
in an infinitely greater degree, to his own profit and advancement. Let us follow
the letters of Cromwell, the narrative of Cavendish, and the records of the Parliament
of 1529, for our facts, but let us draw our own conclusions from them.</p>

<p>‘It chanced me upon All-hallowne day,’ says Cavendish, ‘to come into the Great
Chamber at Assher in the morning, to give mine attendance, where I found Mr. Cromwell
leaning in the great windowe with a Primer in his hand, saying our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Lady mattens: which had bine a strange sight in him afore.—Well, what will you
have more? He prayed no more earnestly, than he distilled teares as fast from his
eyes. Whom I saluted and bad good-morrowe. And with that I perceived his moist
chekes, the which he wiped with his napkine. To whom I saide, “Why, Mr. Cromwell,
what meaneth this dole? Is my lord in any danger that ye doe lament for him? or is
it for any other losse, that ye have sustained by misfortune?” “Nay,” quoth he,
“it is for my unhappy adventure. For I am like to lose all that I have laboured
for, all the daies of my life, for doing of my master true and diligent service.”
“Why Sir,” quoth I, “I trust that you be too wise to do anything by my lord’s
commaundement otherwise than ye might doe, whereof you ought to be in doubt or
daunger for losse of your goods.” “Well, well,” quoth he, “I cannot tell; but this
I see before mine eyes, that everything is as it is taken; and this I knowe well,
that I am disdained withal for my master’s sake; and yet I am sure there is no
cause, why they should do soe. An evill name once gotten will not lightly be put
away. I never had promotion by my lord to the encrease of my living. But this much
I will saye to you, that I will this afternoone, when my lord hath dined, ride to
London, and to the courte, when I will either make or marre, or ever I come
againe. I will put myself in prease, to see what they will be able to lay to my
charge.” “Mary,” quoth I, “then in so doing you shall doe wisely, beseeching God
to send you good lucke, as I would myselfe<a id="FNanchor_147_147"/><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>.”’</p>

<p>Cromwell performed his promise well. He dined with Wolsey on that All-hallowne
Day, and later helped him to discharge his servants, causing his chaplains to pay
part of the yeomen’s wages, in return for the benefices and livings which they had
received from the Cardinal; setting an example himself, with unusual liberality,
by a contribution of five pounds to this end. He then desired of Wolsey leave to
go to London, which was granted, and he departed immediately with Ralph Sadler,
his clerk.</p>

<p>No one knew better than Cromwell that the best place for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
him to ‘make or marre’ the Cardinal’s fortunes and his own, was in the Parliament
which was to meet November 3 (two days later), and, ‘being in London, he devised
with himself to be one of the burgesses<a id="FNanchor_148_148"/><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>.’
He sat as a member from Taunton, as the records of Parliament attest<a id="FNanchor_149_149"/><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>,
but there are very contradictory reports about the way in which he obtained his
seat. According to Cavendish ‘he chaunced to meete with one Sir Thomas Rush,
knighte, a speciall friend of his, whose son was appointed to be a burgess, of
whome he obtained his rome, and so put his fete into the parliament house.’ This
may possibly be true, but it is not the whole truth, for a letter of November 1,
from Sadler to Cromwell, the genuineness of which it is impossible to doubt, hints
at a good deal more than is to be found in Cavendish’s account, which must have
been made from Cromwell’s own story about his proceedings<a id="FNanchor_150_150"/><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>.
This letter reads as follows:—</p>

</div>

<p>From this letter then it seems probable that Cromwell obtained his seat in the
Parliament of 1529 through the influence of the Duke of Norfolk. He was keen-sighted
enough to see that at Wolsey’s fall all the royal favour had been transferred to
this man and to Gardiner. Both of these were Wolsey’s enemies, and Cromwell, whose
name was coupled everywhere with that of the Cardinal, saw that to gain influence
at Court, it was necessary at all costs to do away with their hostility, which he
must have incurred as Wolsey’s agent.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Thus Cromwell’s first move at the time of his master’s disgrace was to take steps
to get himself into favour with Norfolk. Cavendish’s account is explained by the
fact that Cromwell would not have been very likely to tell Wolsey how he had gone
straight over to his bitterest enemy, but far more probably sent back to Esher the
incomplete tale about Rush and his son, which the honest and simple-minded biographer
probably never suspected for an instant. One can hardly doubt that Cromwell would
not have been elected to this Parliament had he not secured the consent of the Cardinal’s
worst foe. He had thus killed two birds with one stone; he had gained his position
in the House of Commons where his influence would be felt, and he had successfully
escaped the odium of the chief person at the Court, which would have naturally
fallen upon him as Wolsey’s servant, and turned it into at least a temporary friendship.</p>

<p>From the contents of the letter above quoted, we may also suppose that Cromwell’s
doings in the Parliament of 1529 were ‘ordered’ by the King. The bill of attainder
or ‘boke of artikels’ against the Cardinal was the first business that lay before
the House. It had passed the Lords and was sent down to the Commons, but it was so
violent and so false, that even Henry and Norfolk relented. It had probably been
very clearly hinted to the Parliament that the King did not wish it to pass, and
royal ‘hints’ at this period of English history were generally respected and obeyed.
Cavendish tells us that when Cromwell had obtained his seat in Parliament, and the
attainder was brought forward, he consulted with Wolsey ‘to know what answer he
might make in his behalf; insomuch that there was nothing alleadged against my
lord but that he was ready to make answer thereto,’ and he inveighed against the
bill ‘so discreetly and with such witty persuasions and depe resons that the same
could take none effect,’ so that ‘at length his honest estimation and earnest behaviour
in his master’s cause grewe so in every man’s opinion, that he was reputed the
most faithful servant to his master of all other, wherein he was greatly of all
men commended<a id="FNanchor_151_151"/><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>.’</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></p>

<p>This is all doubtless true, but whether or not he was alone in the stand he
made against the bill is quite another question. Henry was perfectly satisfied
with humbling the Cardinal to the extent that he had already done, and did not
wish him to suffer any more; in fact the opposition, consisting of most of the
nobles led by Norfolk and Anne Boleyn, were in constant fear up to the day of
Wolsey’s death, lest he should regain the King’s favour. If Cromwell had gone
openly over to the other side at this juncture, he would have gained nothing, and
incurred the odium due to a deserter. He took the only generous and right side,
but in serving his master he served himself far more<a id="FNanchor_152_152"/><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>.
Wolsey, as we have seen, had made a written confession of all his misdeeds as soon
as the first blow had been struck against him<a id="FNanchor_153_153"/><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>.
This confession was produced by Cromwell, and it gave the proposers of the bill
of attainder an excuse for dropping it. Cromwell supplied the pretext for abandoning
a measure displeasing to the King, and consequently impossible to carry through
this very subservient Parliament; by so doing he gained the praise of a saviour
of his master in his extremity.</p>

<p>This was the first step: the second was to win the favour of other nobles,
while still preserving the appearance of loyally serving his fallen master. It
was scarcely less important than the first, and was carried through by Cromwell
with the greatest rapidity and success. His method of accomplishing it, however
simple, was eminently characteristic, and merits description.</p>

<p>It has already been shown how thoroughly Cromwell realized the importance of
money as a political force. Though the traditional reproach of parsimony and
stinginess so often cast at Henry VII.<a id="FNanchor_154_154"/><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
is in great measure unmerited, it is undeniable that his careful financial
management and accurate audits had served to surround his government with an
atmosphere of ostensible frugality. Henry VIII., on the contrary, delighted in
outward splendour and magnificence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his Court was by far the most brilliant that England had ever beheld, and nobody
could play his part there who was not prepared to lavish vast sums upon his
outfit. But the greater part of the nobles were quite unable to do this. It had
been an important part of the plan of Henry VII. for establishing a strong
kingship to keep all possible rivals of the Crown in a state of financial
dependence. Many items in the State Papers of his son’s reign bear witness to the complete success of these schemes of impoverishing the nobility<a id="FNanchor_155_155"/><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>. Only by pawning and selling lands, estates, goods and chattels could the nobility obtain sufficient sums to make a good appearance at the brilliant Court of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Such a state of affairs was a golden opportunity to a man in Cromwell’s position
and of Cromwell’s talents. To Wolsey, whose mind had been intent on the larger
schemes of his foreign policy, the notion of staving off the hatred of the influential
people about the King by gifts of money, would never have occurred. Cromwell hit
upon the scheme in a moment, as the only sure road to favour at the Court<a id="FNanchor_156_156"/><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>.
Now that Wolsey had surrendered himself almost wholly to the counsels of his
painstaking, watchful, close and wholly unscrupulous adviser, Cromwell immediately
persuaded him to grant annuities to the Court favourites. The casual reader must
not deceive himself into thinking that this was done at Wolsey’s own suggestion;
the measure was too evidently Cromwellian to leave any room to doubt its originator,
and if any further proof be needed, it is furnished by evidence in the Cardinal’s
papers. In a letter to Cromwell written in December, 1529, Wolsey says, ‘Yf the
desspleasure of my lady Anne be [some]what asswagyd, as I praye God the same maye
be, then yt shuld [be devised t]hat by sume convenyent meane she be further laboryd
[for th]ys ys the only helpe and remedy. All possyble meanes [must be used for]
atteynyng of hyr favor <span class="nowrap">. . . . . . . . . .</span>  I comyt me to yower wyse handling<a id="FNanchor_157_157"/><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>.’
In the same month Cromwell made out the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
draft of a grant by Wolsey to George Boleyn, Knight, Viscount Rochford, son and
heir apparent of Thomas Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond, bestowing on him an annuity
of £200 out of the lands of the bishopric of Winchester, and a similar gift of
£200 out of the abbey lands of St. Albans<a id="FNanchor_158_158"/><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>.
Another letter from Wolsey to Cromwell in January, 1530, says that, according to
his servant’s advice, he has had Mr. Norris’s fee increased from £100 to £200,
and would like to have Sir John Russell’s annuity of £20 made 40 or 50, if Cromwell
thinks it expedient<a id="FNanchor_159_159"/><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that these and other similar gifts were bestowed at Cromwell’s
advice and suggestion, and that the inevitable consequence was that the advantage
resulting from them accrued to a far greater extent to the Cardinal’s agent than
to the Cardinal himself. Wolsey, in his confinement at Esher, was forced to trust
himself implicitly to the shrewd and selfish counsellor, who moved about among
those whom it was most important for him to propitiate, and soon found means to
make it appear that Wolsey’s favours in reality emanated from him. Cromwell’s
selection of those to whom the presents were made seems also to hint that he was
working in his own interest more than in his master’s. He must have known that the
members of the Boleyn party, to whom the greater part of the grants were made,
hated Wolsey himself too thoroughly to permit them to forget their grudge for the
sake of a few hundred pounds, but the sums bestowed were sufficiently large to
make the recipients of them very friendly to the Cardinal’s agent, who to all
intents and purposes appeared to be the real giver. Hints of all this must indeed
have reached Wolsey’s ears. Though throughout all the period of the attainder his
gratitude, as expressed in his many letters, was, in view of the real facts, most
unnecessarily effusive<a id="FNanchor_160_160"/><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>,
he later writes to Cromwell that he hears ‘he has not done him as good offices as
he might, in connexion with his colleges and his archbishopric.’ But Cromwell had
by this time got everything into his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
hands, so that Wolsey was forced to do exactly as he was bidden. Whenever the
Cardinal undertook anything on his own responsibility, without asking his servant’s
advice, it was greatly resented. If Wolsey dared to hint that Cromwell was not
wholly devoted to his interests, the latter sent back a complaining and half-threatening
reply<a id="FNanchor_161_161"/><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>.
The Cardinal was even forced to write a humble apology to his agent for sending
Edmund Bonner on some mission without his advice<a id="FNanchor_162_162"/><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>.
The less able Wolsey became to help himself, the more harsh and imperious was his
all-powerful counsellor. With the whole control of his master’s interests at the
Court in his own hands, it was exceedingly simple for a man of Cromwell’s peculiar
talents to dispose the funds committed to his care in such ways as tallied best
with his own interests, while casual onlookers simply regarded him as an honest
servant of his fallen master; and Wolsey, unable to learn the true state of affairs
at Court, was kept practically ignorant of his real designs. Cromwell had thus
succeeded in attaining a most enviable position, which was aptly described in a
letter which he received from Stephen Vaughan, who took the opportunity to congratulate
him, and also to warn him against over-confidence in the following words:—‘A mery
semblance of wether often thrustithe men into the Daungerous sees, not thinking
to be sodaynly opprest wythe tempest when vnwar<i>es</i> they be preuented and
brought in great ieop<i>ar</i>die. The Wynd<i>es</i> arn mutable vnsure and will
not be caryed in mennys hand<i>es</i> to blow at a becke. Parell euerywhere followithe
men, from the birthe to the Dethe, And more thretenethe them whiche entreprise
Difficult and vrgent matters, then those whiche only sekethe easy and light
matters ye thoughe they have great apparance of vertue, such is thinstabilitie of
the worlde, wher we find undiq<i>ue</i> miseriam<a id="FNanchor_163_163"/><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>.’</p>

<p>A final opportunity was given to Cromwell to ingratiate himself with King and
nobles when Henry took into his hands the revenues of St. Albans and Winchester,
and of the colleges at Oxford and Ipswich. In this, even honest Cavendish could
see that ‘Cromewell perceyved an occasion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
given him by time to helpe himselfe.’ The intricacies of the law of the period
were such that annuities and fees out of the revenues of these colleges, granted
by the King, after he had seized them, could only be good while Wolsey was living,
because the King, having obtained his right to them by Wolsey’s attainder in the
praemunire, could not retain that right after the Cardinal’s death<a id="FNanchor_164_164"/><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>.
Thus, to have the grants secure during the lifetimes of the recipients, ‘there
was none other shifte but to obtaine my lord’s confirmation of their patents.
Then began every man both noble and gentleman who had any patents out of Winchester
and St. Albans to make suite to Mr. Cromwell to solicit their cause to my lorde
to get therin his confirmation, and for his paines therin bothe worthily to reward
him and every man to shewe him such pleasures as should be at all times in their
small powers, whereof they assured <span class="nowrap">him. . . .</span>  Now began matters to worke to
bringe Master Cromwell into estimation in suche sorte as was muche hereafter to
his increase of dignity; <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and having the ordering and disposition of the
landes of these colleges he had a great occasion of suitors, besides the continual
access to the King, by meanes whereof and through his witty demeanour he grewe
continually into the King’s favour<a id="FNanchor_165_165"/><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>.’</p>

<p>It is hard to realize how deeply Wolsey felt the seizure of his two colleges.
They had been the pride and joy of his declining years. Instead of working earnestly
to avert their surrender into the King’s hands, as a true servant would have done,
Cromwell permitted and almost welcomed it, as a means to give him a chance to
further his own ends, and wrote empty, and, it would seem, almost contemptuous
letters of consolation to the Cardinal, of which that of August 18 is an excellent
example<a id="FNanchor_166_166"/><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.
Instead of going to his master in his sorrow and disgrace, as Wolsey repeatedly
requested him to do, he held himself aloof, and under the pretext of looking after
the Cardinal’s interests at Court, contrived for his own rise and advancement. It
is true that he stood by Wolsey in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the parliamentary crisis in 1529, and that it was largely through his efforts
that Wolsey obtained his temporary pardon in February, 1530; but when, at the
last, the Cardinal’s enemies turned against him a second time and secured his
complete downfall, there is no record of Cromwell’s saying a word or doing a
thing in his behalf. On November 29, 1530, Wolsey died, shattered and disgraced.</p>

<p>It is very unfortunate that there still exist so few of Cromwell’s letters
during the last two years of Wolsey’s life. There are preserved at present only
twelve letters from him during this period<a id="FNanchor_167_167"/><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>,
seven of which are addressed to Wolsey. In none of them does he give evidence of
a sincere desire to serve his master at all costs; the dominant note of the
greater part of them is one of selfish and rather supercilious advice; of a
morality easy and cheap, because the preacher of it evidently felt himself beyond
the possibility of its ever being applicable in his own case. There is also very
little trustworthy information about the means he employed to introduce himself
to the King, except what has already been mentioned in connexion with Wolsey’s
fall. Foxe asserts that Sir Christopher Hales, Master of the Rolls, commended him
to Henry, and further affirms that Sir John Russell said a good word for him, in
return for Cromwell’s saving his life at Bologna, so that the latter was enabled
to have a private conversation with the King in Westminster Gardens<a id="FNanchor_168_168"/><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>.
Part of this story is obviously false; Cromwell could not have been at Bologna
when Sir John Russell was (between 1524 and 1528), because he was occupied in
England at that time, as his correspondence shows. To judge from this, little
reliance can be placed on the rest of Foxe’s tale; and there are no contemporary
documents that bear out his statements. Another story, which is perhaps more
probable, is that of Chapuys<a id="FNanchor_169_169"/><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>,
who states that at Wolsey’s death Sir John Wallop attacked Cromwell with insults
and threats, so that the latter for protection procured an audience with Henry,
whom he promised to make the richest king that ever was in England. Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
it appears, was so struck with this offer, that he immediately made Cromwell a
member of his Council, but told nobody about it for four months. This tale is in
many respects similar to the account contained in Pole’s Apologia: but the story
of the Cardinal does not mention the quarrel with Wallop, and the report of
Chapuys does not say a word about the plan for the solution of Henry’s ‘grete
matier’ by which Cromwell, according to Pole, completely fascinated the King. All
the accounts, however, seem to agree that by some means he managed to secure an
interview with Henry soon after Wolsey’s death, at which he clinched everything
that he had already gained, and obtained the favour of the King by one master-stroke.
Pole’s story of this interview contains information which leads us into the thick
of Cromwell’s political career. Before we proceed to examine it in detail a brief
chapter must be devoted to a description of the actors and past events of the
great political drama in which Cromwell was to play a part, and to a further
analysis of his own character and ideals.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE CHARACTER AND OPPORTUNITY OF THOMAS CROMWELL</p>

<p>The condition of England at the time of Wolsey’s death was in many ways an
extraordinary one. At home and abroad she had already begun to reap glorious
fruits from the untiring efforts and masterful policy of the first Tudor. United
under a powerful monarchy, which had strengthened itself at the expense of every
other institution in the realm, she rested secure in the enjoyment of internal
peace and of a high degree of estimation and respect in foreign lands. That she
had lost nearly all those continental possessions which had been the proudest
boast of Edward III. and Henry V. now proved an inestimable advantage. The wise
Cardinal had made use of England’s insular position to such good advantage, that
she had been able, at least up to the time when the political situation had been
complicated by the question of the divorce, to keep the Emperor and the King of
France in a state of constant anxiety concerning her real attitude, and often to
force the two rivals to bid against each other for her alliance. In 1521 Henry
had dedicated to Leo X. a treatise which he had written against the heresies of
Luther, and had been rewarded with the proud title of ‘Defensor Fidei.’ Success
abroad meant popularity at home, at least for the King, whose enthusiasm and
winning manners endeared him to his subjects, and who usually contrived to shift
the blame for the unwelcome measures of his government on to the shoulders of the
Cardinal. As long as the national honour was upheld on the Continent without
draining too deeply the resources of the people at home, the country seemed quite
willing to trust the King to the full and to allow him to rule as well as govern.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></p>

<p>Such was the bright side of the picture, the side which first claims the
attention of the casual observer. A more critical examination of the state of the
country, however, reveals an undercurrent of discontent, which was almost lost in
the crowning years of Wolsey’s greatness, but which did not fail to make itself
felt at a later day, when the allegiance of so large a part of the people had
been alienated by the affair of the divorce. The surest proof that Henry and
Wolsey were aware of this latent hostility is afforded by the infrequent assemblings
of Parliament. Seldom did the King dare to face the representatives of the nation
with the demand for a subsidy; he preferred to veil his oppressive financial
exactions under the name of an Amicable Loan. The poverty of the nobles was
notorious; and the distress of the poor people daily increased owing to a succession
of bad seasons, thin harvests, and a few outbreaks of a devastating plague. Economic
and agrarian changes contributed to swell the universal discontent<a id="FNanchor_170_170"/><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.
The break-up of the old manorial system, the increase of enclosures for pasturage,
and the substitution of convertible husbandry for the old three-field system all
served to displace labour, and so temporarily to diminish the demand for it. Great
distress among the agricultural poor was necessarily the first result of these
changes: unfortunately economic science was not sufficiently advanced to enable
men to discern that it was but a passing phase, and that as soon as labour had
adjusted itself to the new conditions permanent advantages to it were bound to
ensue. The country-folk contrasted their own wretched condition with the many
reports which reached them of Henry’s sumptuous and luxurious Court: small wonder
if the government was wrongly blamed for a large share of the misery which was
inevitably the first consequence of sudden and great economic development. Finally
all malcontents were united in opposition to the King’s attempts to gain a divorce
from his first wife, during the closing years of Wolsey’s ministry; so that the
maintenance and further strengthening of the powerful monarchy established at the
accession of the House of Tudor promised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in the near future to afford a problem of even greater difficulty than before.</p>

<p>To turn for a moment to the situation on the Continent. The House of Hapsburg,
under Charles V., seemed to have attained the acme of its greatness, but its power
was not by any means as real as it appeared. The Emperor’s insatiable desire for
foreign conquest had caused him to neglect affairs in Spain and in the Empire, and
to overtax his powers and drain his resources by continual struggles with his
great rival the King of France. The bone of contention was ostensibly Italy;
perhaps a truer cause of the struggles of the two sovereigns is to be found in
the geographical position of the countries over which they ruled. The newly-consolidated
realm of France divided the dominions of the Emperor into two parts: the dream of
Charles was to connect them; the object of Francis was to forestall him. Northern
Italy belonged to neither, but it was a rich prize and a fighting-ground easily
accessible to both the combatants, and so it very naturally became the field of
war. Soon after the Imperial election of 1519 the tide began to set slowly but
surely against Francis; he was a true soldier, and was not a man to submit to any
encroachment without a struggle; still he fought at a terrible disadvantage,
betrayed as he was by the Duke of Bourbon, and in 1525 he was forced to acknowledge
a thorough defeat, at the fatal battle of Pavia<a id="FNanchor_171_171"/><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.</p>

<p>Although the first idea that occurred to Henry and Wolsey after the news of
Charles’ great victory had reached them was a plan for the conquest and subdivision
of the kingdom of Francis, they soon came to the conclusion that such a scheme
would render the Emperor far too powerful. Charles himself, moreover, had received
with little favour the extravagant proposals for an invasion of France which
England had sent him as soon as the result of Pavia was known, and had consistently
refused to allow Henry any share in his triumph. The Pope also, who had watched
with terror the victorious march of the Imperial army, ventured for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the last time to present himself as the centre of the opposition to Charles V.,
and strove in every way to reconcile England and France. The obstinate resistance
that the Commissioners for the collection of the Amicable Loan had encountered in
the spring of 1525 was certainly no encouragement for undertaking a war of
aggression, and Henry and Wolsey soon determined to abandon all plans of invasion,
and to pursue the wiser policy of maintaining neutrality between the two great
continental powers. With this thought in mind a treaty of peace was made with
Francis in August, and after the escape of the French King from captivity in
January, 1526, the two continental rivals were once more placed on an even footing.
With this restoration of equality Henry was perfectly satisfied, and he took good
care to avoid committing himself permanently to Francis, by refusing openly to
join the League of Cognac in the following spring. At this juncture the matter of
the divorce began to occupy his exclusive attention, and the foreign affairs of
the next three years were left almost entirely in Wolsey’s hands.</p>

<p>Circumstances now drove the Cardinal temporarily to lose sight of the policy
which he had pursued for the most part up to this time—that of strict neutrality—and
to attempt to convert the peace with France into a permanent alliance. And
certainly the events of 1527 seemed to give him every justification for this new
departure. The sack of Rome appeared to put Italy at the mercy of the Imperialists,
and now the difficulties connected with Henry’s matrimonial affairs pointed to
the need of securing a firm ally who would aid him in persuading the captive
Pontiff to consent to the divorce in opposition to the wishes of his jailor the
Emperor. With all his experience the Cardinal had hardly learned how rapidly the
diplomatic combinations of Europe could change. The last great venture of his
foreign policy resulted in disaster: the French alliance utterly failed to
accomplish what was expected of it. At first indeed it seemed that the matrimonial
projects which formed the basis of it would succeed, but the crafty policy of
Francis ruined all. His war with the Emperor broke out again, as was to be
expected, immediately after his release<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
from captivity, but secret negotiations for peace were soon set on foot, and
finally, in 1529, took shape in the treaty of Cambray—the news of which came as a
stunning blow to Wolsey’s dearest hopes. The lesson which the Cardinal learned at
the expense of his office was by no means lost on his master. Absorbed in the
attempt to obtain a divorce from Katherine, Henry possibly had not been able to
foresee the course of events abroad any better than his minister; but when, in
1529, the news of the treaty of Cambray aroused him to a true appreciation of the
state of affairs, he at once realized how dangerous any permanent alliance with
either Francis or Charles would be, as long as the situation on the Continent
remained so uncertain. He resolved that, as soon as he could rectify the Cardinal’s
false step, nothing should tempt him again to abandon the only safe policy—that
of strict neutrality between the two great European powers—as long as the two
rivals remained nearly equal. This point has been purposely dwelt upon here as a
foreshadowing of what was to happen to Cromwell a few years later. Departure from
the policy of neutrality between France and Spain helped to ruin Wolsey: a similar
blunder in foreign affairs was destined to lead his successor to destruction.</p>

<p>The entire attention of England was now turned to the absorbing question of
the divorce. The history of Wolsey’s failure to bring about the separation of
Henry and Katherine of Aragon, does not belong to the ground covered by this
essay. Suffice it to say that the Cardinal’s ineffectual attempts to satisfy
Henry’s chief desire, coupled with the obvious error in his foreign policy,
sealed his doom and gave Cromwell his opportunity. There is little need to dwell
upon the way in which the attempt to divorce the Queen was regarded abroad. Henry
was looked upon as the disturber of Christian unity, not only by the Emperor, but
also by all continental Europe<a id="FNanchor_172_172"/><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.
Charles, of course, was the obvious person to avenge the wrongs of his aunt, but
he was far too busy just then with his schemes for suppressing the Protestants in
Germany and of checking the advance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Turk into the borders of Christendom, seriously to contemplate an invasion of
Henry’s dominions. It was not the only time that England’s fortunes were saved by
the turn of affairs in distant lands.</p>

<p>It now remains only to say a few words about the chief persons at the Court of
Henry VIII., preliminary to a description of Cromwell himself. Foremost among
these was of course Anne Boleyn. Born probably in 1507 of a good English family,
a niece of the Earl of Surrey, she had spent a good part of her early life in
France, as ‘one of the French queen’s women,’ and returned to England in the
latter part of the year 1521<a id="FNanchor_173_173"/><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.
At Henry’s exceedingly corrupt Court she did not want for admirers and suitors,
foremost among whom was the King himself, who had formerly been in intimate
relations with her sister Mary. Henry’s passion for her is sufficiently attested
by a succession of royal grants and favours to her father, beginning only two
months after her arrival in England, and continuing for over three years<a id="FNanchor_174_174"/><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a>.
How far Anne was responsible for causing Henry to take steps to divorce Katherine,
and how far he was moved thereto by a conscience that became over-sensitive at
suspiciously short notice, or by more legitimate political considerations, it is
not our business now to inquire; our best sources of information are the grants
to her father, above mentioned, and a most remarkable series of love-letters<a id="FNanchor_175_175"/><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.
Though she temporarily had the King at her feet, no woman of Henry’s Court was
really to be less envied. Katherine and Mary, and, in consequence, the majority
of the people, were her bitter foes; to protect herself against the popular odium,
she gathered round her a following, known at Court as the Boleyn faction, the
chief person of which was her uncle, now Duke of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Norfolk was fifty-seven years old when Cromwell came into power. He was a
Catholic and against the New Faith. He had received in his younger days a thorough
military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> and diplomatic
training, and in 1531 was characterized by the Venetian ambassador, Falieri, as
‘prudent, liberal, affable, and astute; associating with everybody <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and
desirous of greater elevation.’ This is a very flattering description of this
crafty and ambitious statesman. The chief traits that characterized him were a
cringing subservience to the will of the King, and a bitter hatred of any rival
to his influence with Henry; a hatred which first directed itself against Wolsey,
for whose downfall he laboured incessantly, and later against Cromwell, whose
opponent he was during the decade of the former’s greatness. He was the equal of
neither of these two as a statesman; but his utter lack of honour and consistency,
and his willingness to break promises in order to please the King, rendered him
an invaluable servant of the Crown at a period when one startling change followed
on the heels of another. He threw himself heart and soul into the interests of his
niece when Henry’s love for her was increasing; and yet when the royal passion
waned, and Anne was accused in 1536, he was not ashamed to preside at her trial
and sentence her to death<a id="FNanchor_176_176"/><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>.</p>

<p>The other important person at the Court was Stephen Gardiner, who in 1531
became Bishop of Winchester. Ten years Norfolk’s junior, he was introduced into
political and diplomatic life by the Duke, and spent a large part of his early
life as Wolsey’s servant and ambassador. He did not cherish any lasting friendship
for the Cardinal, however, and he seems to have been an adherent of the Boleyn
faction at Wolsey’s fall; we find Anne writing to him when the struggle between
the two parties was at its hottest, to thank him for his ‘wylling and faythefull
mynde<a id="FNanchor_177_177"/><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>.’
Still he took more or less a middle course on the divorce question, and pleaded
warmly, though vainly, for the restitution of Wolsey’s colleges. But when the
Cardinal’s fate was settled he certainly expected that his old master’s favour
with the King would be transferred to himself, and when he was disappointed in
this by Cromwell’s stepping in, he developed a hatred for him which he never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
abandoned. He was less active than Norfolk in his opposition to Rome, and though
he lacked the Duke’s subserviency, he was fully as able a diplomat. Neither of
the two men could have played the rôle of Cromwell: the scope of their talents
was more limited; they were merely exceedingly able politicians, but as such they
were by no means to be despised. When, however, they united to procure their rival’s
ruin it was difficult to resist them<a id="FNanchor_178_178"/><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus when at Wolsey’s fall Cromwell entered the King’s service, the situation
of England both at home and abroad was critical in the extreme. The relations of
the government with Rome were strained, owing to Henry’s proceedings in the divorce;
his ‘grete matier’ was unpopular with the country at large; France and Spain were
both of them very doubtful quantities, and might become friends or foes at any
moment. At the Court, various factions with different aims were disputing for the
precedence, and the best course to be steered by one who was about to enter the
King’s service, after leaving that of a fallen minister, was not an easy thing to
decide. Before inquiring into Cromwell’s action at this crisis, a brief description
of the person and of the character of the man himself at this time will not be
out of place.</p>

<p>Cromwell was a short, strongly-built man, with a large dull face. He was
smooth-shaven, with close-cropped hair, and had a heavy double chin. His mouth
was small and cruel, and was surmounted by an extraordinarily long upper lip,
while a pair of grey eyes, set closely together, moved restlessly under his light
eyebrows. He had an awkward, uncouth gait which lent itself well to the other
peculiarities of his personal appearance, and gave one the idea that he was a
patient, plodding, and, if anything, a rather stupid sort of man. But this was
all merely external. According to Chapuys, who knew him well, he possessed the
most extraordinary mobility of countenance, so that when engaged in an interesting
conversation, his face would suddenly light up, and the dull, drudging, commonplace
expression give way to a subtle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
cunning, and intelligent aspect, quite at variance with his ordinary appearance.
His conversation at such moments was witty and entertaining to the last degree,
and the Spanish ambassador notes that he had the habit of giving a roguish oblique
glance whenever he made a striking remark. This extraordinary power of facial
control, according to the circumstances in which he was placed, merely reflects
one of the dominant characteristics of the man. He obviously had remarkable power
of quickly adapting himself to his surroundings. He rarely failed to realize
immediately his relation to those with whom he came in contact, and his manner,
behaviour, and expression varied accordingly. No one knew better how or when to
flatter than Thomas Cromwell; on the other hand no one could be more harsh and
cruel than he, when he was in a position to dictate. He had thoroughly learned
the lesson</p>

      <div class="verse mleft3">‘To beguile the time</div>
      <div class="verse">Look like the time.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>There are many evidences of his good taste and love of beautiful things<a id="FNanchor_179_179"/><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.
A long and complicated correspondence with his friend Stephen Vaughan about an
iron chest of very curious workmanship, which he wanted for his house at Austin
Friars, of such expense that Vaughan was almost afraid to buy it, is not without
interest. There is record of his purchasing a globe, with a set of explanatory
notes, and the only two ‘Cronica Cronicarum cum figuris’ that could be found in
all Antwerp<a id="FNanchor_180_180"/><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>.
Especially great was his love of Italian things. His stay in Italy was of
sufficient duration to steep him in the spirit of the Renaissance; he read and
studied his Machiavelli, so that it was a guide to his future political career;
we can well imagine him repeating to himself the sentence in chapter xviii of The
Prince which begins ‘Ma è necessario questa natura saperla bene colorire, ed
essere gran simulatore e dissimulatore<a id="FNanchor_181_181"/><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>,’
or the passage in chapter xvii of the same, ‘Deve pertanto un principe non si
curare dell’infamia di crudele per tenere i sudditi suoi uniti ed in fede<a id="FNanchor_182_182"/><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.’
He doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> possessed many
of the important Italian books in print at that time. In April, 1530, Edmund
Bonner writes to him to remind him of his promise to lend him the Triumphs of
Petrarch and the Cortigiano, and to make him a good Italian<a id="FNanchor_183_183"/><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>.</p>

<p>Of his social gifts and of his charm as a host there is no room to doubt.
There are many proofs that he was a most magnificent entertainer, and that his
personal attraction, when he wished to make himself agreeable, was such that no
one could resist it. The letters of Chapuys inform us that even the most careful
and experienced politicians were often completely put off their guard by Cromwell’s
pleasing presence and address; and more than once were induced to say things which
should not have escaped them.</p>

<p>But all these manners and externals were simply disguises to hide the real
inward character of the man. The whole essence of Cromwell’s personality consists
of different manifestations of one fundamental, underlying trait, which may
perhaps be best expressed by the common phrase ‘a strict attention to business.’
Cromwell worshipped and sought after the practical and the useful only, and utterly
disregarded everything else. The first evidence of this quality has been already
noticed, as coming in the shape of a contempt for the vague generalizations of the
Parliament of 1523, which beat about the bush for an entire session without ever
coming to the point<a id="FNanchor_184_184"/><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.
Here it assumes a somewhat negative form. Another striking instance of it occurs
in the conversation which Pole relates as having taken place between himself and
Cromwell, at Wolsey’s house, concerning the proper duty of a true servant of a
Prince<a id="FNanchor_185_185"/><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>.
Pole as usual began theorizing about the best way to bring honour to one’s master,
when he was rudely interrupted by Cromwell, who advised him in few words to
forsake the remote learning of the schools, and devote himself to reading a new
book which took a practical view of the case, and which Pole later found was the
adviser’s favourite Prince of Machiavelli. Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at the same time took occasion to tell Pole that the great art of the politician
was to penetrate through the disguise which sovereigns are accustomed to throw
over their real inclinations, and to devise the most specious expedients by which
they may gratify their appetites without appearing to outrage morality or religion<a id="FNanchor_186_186"/><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>.
It is not astonishing that Pole realized that it was dangerous for him to remain
in England, when Cromwell came into power.</p>

<p>Another more positive and striking way in which this characteristic stood
forth, was in his utter lack of emotion. It was this quality which enabled Cromwell
to tick off in his memoranda the lives of human beings, as if they were items in
an account; or to send people to trials, of which the verdicts had been determined
beforehand, as ‘the Abbott of Redyng to be Sent Down to be tryed &amp; excecutyd
at Reding<a id="FNanchor_187_187"/><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>.’
He totally disregarded the justness or morality of any action; its utility was
for him its morality, and created its justification. He never struck at his
victims in a moment of passion, uselessly or capriciously; no personal feeling of
hatred mingled with his crime. On the other hand, had the sacrifice of one of his
nearest or dearest friends been necessary to the accomplishment of his purposes,
he would hardly have hesitated a moment. Any means that could bring about the ends
he sought were <i>ipso facto</i> for him justifiable. Whether his desires were
attained by fair means or foul, mattered little to him: he kept his eyes steadily
fixed upon the goal; the smoothness or roughness of the road to it was of no
consequence in his eyes<a id="FNanchor_188_188"/><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most important of all, Cromwell never lost anything that
might be turned to good account. It has been shown how he not only succeeded in
freeing himself from any ill-name at Wolsey’s fall, but also actually used his
master’s overthrow to further his own ends, and make himself known and popular at
Court. But this is only a slender hint of what was to follow. It was precisely
from this same practical utilitarian standpoint, that he regarded and made use of
to his own ends the King’s amours, the suppression of the monasteries, the Reformation.
Catholicism and Protestantism passed over his head; he was not touched by either
of them. He simply used them as pieces in the great game which he was playing.</p>

<p>Such was the man who, for the next ten years, was to have almost the sole
guidance of the course of English history. As was his purpose when he rode on the
afternoon of All Hallows Day to London to look after his own interests and those
of his master, so was his mission as minister and counsellor of the King, ‘to make
or to marre.’</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">IN THE KING’S SERVICE</p>

<p>The decade which followed Cromwell’s appointment as counsellor to Henry VIII.
witnessed some of the most striking changes that have ever taken place in England.
The question which must obviously occur to every student of the period, is whether
the King himself, or his new minister, was the real cause of the secular and
religious revolution of the years 1530 to 1540. The difficulty of the problem is
increased by the fact that Henry and Cromwell made every effort to conceal their
traces; scarcely any information can be gleaned from their correspondence. We are
therefore forced to draw our conclusions for the most part from external evidence
and the reports of contemporary writers.</p>

<p>It may be justly said that in general the probabilities point to Cromwell as the
true originator of the startling changes which occurred soon after his accession
to power. The fact that the ultimate object of all these changes was the concentration
of power in the hands of the Crown is not in itself of great value in determining
the identity of their originator; for the strengthening of the monarchy was an end
which both King and minister always kept in view: in the methods by which this
object was attained, however, we have a most valuable clue to aid us in the solution
of our problem. These methods were all intensely Cromwellian: their directness and
efficiency are essentially and distinctively characteristic of the King’s new minister.
In the contrast between the dawdling ineffectiveness of Wolsey’s device for solving
the problem of the King’s divorce, and the summary, revolutionary process by which
it was finally secured after the Cardinal’s fall, lies our strongest ground for
supposing that it was at Cromwell’s instance that the decisive step was taken. It
seems almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> impossible that
Henry, after having suffered himself to be guided so long by Wolsey, in the
management of his ‘grete matier’ should have adopted at the Cardinal’s death a
plan to secure his wishes, so thoroughly repugnant to the principles of his old
adviser, unless the idea had been put into his head by another. When the King had
once determined to break with Rome, it followed as a matter of course that the
advice of the minister who had suggested the first step, should be adopted in
devising measures to secure the King in the new position which he had assumed. The
means employed to attain this end—the intimidation of the clergy and the suppression
of the monasteries, the attacks on the independence of Parliament, the ruthless
execution of those who opposed the late innovations—all bear the stamp of the
sinister genius of Cromwell as unmistakably as the great revolution that rendered
them necessary. Documentary evidence too comes in to help us here; scarcely an
important Act was passed in Parliament between the years 1533 and 1540, of which
there is not some previous mention in Cromwell’s papers and memoranda. Against
these reasons it may be urged that none of the foreign ambassadors at the English
Court mentions Cromwell as an important factor in the government until three years
after he entered the King’s service, and that the country in general certainly
regarded the events of the years 1530 to 1533 as the work of Henry alone; and that
these facts are strong testimony that the King’s new minister did not attain any
high degree of prominence until the crucial period of the struggle with Rome had
passed. But this paucity of contemporary information concerning Cromwell’s earlier
years in the King’s service may be better explained in another way. If Henry’s new
minister was the true author of all the revolutionary measures of this period, it
was certainly most unlikely that he should be paraded before the eyes of the people
as such; it was, on the contrary, to his own interest, and also to the King’s,
that he should be kept in the background. By permitting the people to think that
Henry was the real originator of all the new schemes for establishing the Royal
Supremacy in Church and State, the suddenness of the transition between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Wolsey’s ministry and that of his successor was disguised. Moreover, had the
people known that Cromwell was at the bottom of these changes, which were universally
unpopular, nothing would have saved him from their revenge. As long as the new
measures were attributed to the King, respect for the royal name was enough to
prevent a revolt. Cromwell, on the contrary, who was not even of noble birth,
could not have struck a blow in his own defence, had the people fastened upon him
as the cause of the hated innovations. It was necessary to keep him concealed until
his position was so secure that the popular odium could not shake him from it.
When, in 1533, the mask was finally thrown off, Chapuys and the other foreign ambassadors
realized all at once that Cromwell’s sudden burst into prominence would have been
quite impossible, had not the ground been thoroughly prepared for it by important
services rendered during the first years of his ministry.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the general reasons for thinking that Cromwell was the man who
planned out and carried through the various measures which have rendered famous
the period of his ministry. In examining separately the different events which
took place, we shall meet with other evidence which points to the same conclusion.
Most important is the account contained in Pole’s Apologia ad Carolum Quintum,
which describes at length Cromwell’s first measure, his plan to secure Henry’s
divorce from Katherine of Aragon; a scheme by which he won the confidence of the
King and irrevocably committed himself and his master to the policy which he followed
to the end of his days. Henry, it seems from Pole’s story, had become utterly
discouraged at the time of Wolsey’s death concerning the prospect of ever obtaining
a separation from his first wife. He had vainly attempted to get an encouraging
reply from the English clergy, and his failure in this added to his despondency;
his council, which lacked all initiative, could only rejoice that he intended to
abandon his efforts. At this juncture the <i>Satanae Nuncius</i>, as Pole names
Cromwell, solicited and obtained an audience with the King, and proposed a plan
by which Henry could free himself from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Papal restrictions, marry Anne, divorce Katherine, and yet ostensibly remain true
to the Catholic Faith.</p>

<p>Cromwell introduced himself with his usual tact and skill. In a few modest and
carefully selected sentences he excused himself for daring to offer an opinion on
a subject of which he felt himself to be so very ignorant—but, he continued, his
loyalty to the King would not permit him to be silent when there was the smallest
chance of his being able to serve his sovereign at this momentous crisis. He was
certain, he said, that the King’s troubles were solely due to the weakness of his
advisers, who listened to the opinions of the common herd, and did not dare to act
upon their own responsibility. All the wise and learned were in favour of the
divorce; the only thing lacking was the Papal sanction; was the King to hesitate
because this could not be obtained? It would be better to follow the example of
the Lutherans, who had renounced the authority of Rome. Let the King, with the
consent of Parliament, declare himself Head of the Church in England, and all his
difficulties would vanish. England was at present a monster with two heads. If
the King should take to himself the supreme power, religious as well as secular,
every incongruity would cease; the clergy would immediately realize that they were
responsible to the King and not to the Pope, and would forthwith become subservient
to the royal will. Henry may have been surprised by the audacity of Cromwell’s
scheme, but he was also much pleased, as it promised to satisfy all his dearest
wishes. The <i>Satanae Nuncius</i> received his hearty thanks, and was further
rewarded by a seat in the Privy Council<a id="FNanchor_189_189"/><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>.</p>

<p>Cromwell must have realized from the first, that the adoption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of his scheme to throw off the Papal authority in England would encounter the
greatest opposition from the clergy, but he had already devised a plan by which
every objection could be silenced and the refractory ecclesiastics overawed. His
whole policy in this crisis was based on the knowledge that the position of the
clergy since Wolsey’s fall was completely altered. They were no longer in any
sense popular. The State Papers of the period contain many lists of the grievances
of the Commons against them<a id="FNanchor_190_190"/><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>.
They had received a severe lesson from the Parliament of 1529; they were now
isolated, timid and demoralized. Cromwell was the first to perceive and make use
of their changed condition. At the same time he realized how completely the House
of Austria had possessed itself of the Papacy; the failure of Wiltshire’s embassy
to the Emperor in Bologna, in 1530<a id="FNanchor_191_191"/><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>,
assured him, if he needed any assurance, that the day of compromise with the Pope
was passed, and that no divorce would ever come from the Vatican; he saw that if
a separation of Henry and Katherine was to be secured at all, the battle-ground on
which it was to be won was not the Papal Curia at Rome, but the Houses of Convocation
and Parliament.</p>

<p>So it was conveniently discovered that Wolsey’s guilt was shared by Convocation,
the Privy Council and the Lords and Commons, and indirectly by the nation itself;
as all these had recognized the Cardinal in his capacity of legate, and so had become,
by language of the statute, his ‘fautors and abettors.’ Again conveniently, but
also most unreasonably, while the laity, who had eagerly availed themselves of the
Cardinal’s jurisdiction, were tacitly passed over, the clergy who had been the only
ones to make a stand in opposition to the legatine authority, were included in the
Praemunire. So in December, 1530, as Holinshed quaintly puts it, ‘the kings learned
councell said plainlie’ that the ‘whole cleargie of England <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> were all in the
premunire<a id="FNanchor_192_192"/><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>,’
and the Attorney-General was instructed to file a brief against the entire body in
the Court of King’s Bench. The clergy then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
assembled in Convocation, ‘and offered the King 100,000 pounds to be their good
lord, and also to give them a pardon of all offences touching the Praemunire, by
act of Parliament.’ To their surprise and dismay, however, Henry refused the bribe,
unless, in the preamble to the grant, a clause were introduced making him ‘to be
the Protector and only Supreme Head of the Church and clergy of England<a id="FNanchor_193_193"/><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>.’
The whole plot on the part of the King and the Privy Council was conducted with
the greatest possible secrecy, and their real motives were probably not guessed at
by the world outside. Even the astute Chapuys was completely deceived respecting
the King’s actual intention. In his letters of the 23rd and 31st of January, 1531,
he informs the Emperor that ‘when the King has bled the clergy, he will restore to
them their liberties, and take them back into his favour,’ and later declares that
‘the whole thing was done to bring about a union between the clergy and the
nobles<a id="FNanchor_194_194"/><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>.’
It was not until the 14th of February, when the entire affair had been carried
through, that the Spanish ambassador really understood what was happening, and
discovered that it was all something more than a striking exhibition of Tudor
avarice<a id="FNanchor_195_195"/><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime a number of Latin manifestoes appeared favouring the King’s
divorce, and inveighing against the Papal Supremacy<a id="FNanchor_196_196"/><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.
But in spite of all these intimidations, the clergy though weak did not intend to
surrender without a struggle. We are told that ‘ille de suprematu regis conceptus
haud bene placuit praelatis et clero, inde eum modificari voluerunt. Per tres itaque
sessiones cum consiliariis regiis (among whom Cromwell doubtless was most prominent)
ratio inita fuit quomodo regis animum flectere possent ad mollioribus verbis exprimendum
articulum illum<a id="FNanchor_197_197"/><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>.’
At first Henry announced to the clergy through Rochford that the only alteration
he would accept would be the insertion of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
words ‘post Deum.’ In the end, however, he yielded in this point, and consented
to an amendment moved by Archbishop Warham, so that in its final form the clause
read ‘Ecclesiae et cleri Anglicani, cujus singularem protectorem, unicum et supremum
dominicum, et quantum per Christi legem licet etiam supremum caput ipsius majestatem
recognoscimus.’ Both the Canterbury and York Convocations hastened to accept this
compromise, and the latter voted an additional grant of £18,000. The only bishop
who raised the slightest objection to the royal demand was Cuthbert Tunstall, of
Durham. It is obvious that if the famous ‘quantum per Christi legem licet’ was
really enforced, the victory which the King’s party had gained was but an empty
one: the amendment has been characterized as ‘a clause by which all practical
value was taken out of the act<a id="FNanchor_198_198"/><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>.’
But Henry certainly had no idea of permitting a restriction as vague as this
seriously to interfere with his schemes; if the qualification became really
troublesome he was quite prepared to have it expunged. For the moment he had been
willing tacitly to acknowledge that there was some force in the clause in order
to overcome the obstinacy of his opponents, but Chapuys was certainly not far
wrong in saying that it was ‘all the same as far as the King is concerned as if
they had made no reservation, for no one will now be so bold as to contest with
his lord the importance of this reservation<a id="FNanchor_199_199"/><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.’
The long-deferred pardon was at last granted: though when it was first sent down
from the Lords, the Commons discovered that the laity were not mentioned and so
were still in the Praemunire: a deputation from the Lower House, however, waited
upon the King and expressed their doubts, and though at first Henry treated them
harshly, he finally succumbed, and the laity were included in the pardon<a id="FNanchor_200_200"/><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>.</p>

<p>But the struggle was not yet over. The following year witnessed a continuation
of the attacks on the independence of the clergy. This time, however, Henry and Cromwell
had determined that the brunt of the battle should be borne by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Parliament, which responded to the mandates of the King and his minister with gratifying
celerity. Shortly after the opening of the session, in January, 1532, there appeared
in the Lower House that famous document, which is usually known as the ‘Supplication
of the Commons against the Ordinaries<a id="FNanchor_201_201"/><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>.’
The designation is certainly misleading: so preponderant was the part played by one
of the Commons in the preparation of this memorable petition, that it cannot be fairly
regarded as the work of them all. The nature of the charges of which the ‘Supplication’
was composed, its phraseology and the handwritings in the various drafts of it which
are preserved to us to-day<a id="FNanchor_202_202"/><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
leave little doubt that it was originally devised by the genius of Cromwell. It was
in fact the first of a number of measures ostensibly emanating from Parliament,
but in reality prepared by the King’s minister and forced by him upon the very
tractable Lords and Commons. The purport of the supplication was, in brief, to
accuse the clergy of making laws and ordinances without the assent of the King or
his lay subjects, of demanding excessive fees, of dealing corruptly and unfairly,
especially with cases of heresy, and to request the King to take measures for the
remedy of these abuses. The Ordinaries, to whom the petition was delivered from
the King on April 12, at once composed a temperate and dignified reply, in which
the injustice and unreasonableness of the charges preferred against them were
courteously but plainly pointed out<a id="FNanchor_203_203"/><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.
Parliament in the meantime had been prorogued for three months, but as soon as it
had reassembled it was forced to take up the cudgels again<a id="FNanchor_204_204"/><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>.
The clergy had stated their case so well that Henry, in dread lest the faint-hearted
Commons should abandon too soon a quarrel into which his minister had led them,
thought it advisable to intervene himself in the dispute. A short interview between
the King and the Speaker was enough to reanimate the drooping spirits of the House:
Henry was even spared the trouble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of a frank avowal of his attitude in words—a gracious promise to be ‘indifferent’
between the disputants was quite sufficient to ensure the continuance of the
struggle. The Ordinaries were not slow to discover that their first reply had been
totally ineffectual, and hastened to compose a second which, though maintaining in
general the position which had originally been assumed, contained a concession
that no new laws should be published without the royal consent<a id="FNanchor_205_205"/><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.
A good deal more haggling, however, was necessary before the final compromise was
reached<a id="FNanchor_206_206"/><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>.
In fact matters moved so slowly that the King was obliged to make (or let Cromwell
make for him) another of his suspiciously timely discoveries to the effect that
his sovereign rights as Supreme Head were not clear, because every bishop at his
consecration had made an oath of allegiance to the Pope. The Commons were asked
to rectify this, and were about to pass severe censure on the bishops, when they
were prorogued once more on account of the ragings of the plague. Before he let
them go, however, the King had probably ascertained that the clergy intended to
submit. Threatened on all sides, Convocation on the 16th of May finally agreed not
to pass any more new regulations without the King’s licence, and to examine and
revise, according to the royal wishes, the canons already made<a id="FNanchor_207_207"/><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>.
The most important result of the controversy for us to notice is that the King,
acting (as he evidently did) on the advice of Cromwell, had succeeded in reducing
Convocation to complete subjugation, and in making Parliament pliant to his will,
as it had never been before. The scheme of controlling the clergy is doubly significant,
first, as the cause of a great change in itself; second, as the first step of the
dominant policy of the next ten years, for establishing the Royal Supremacy in
Church and State. It must not be forgotten however that Cromwell’s action, in
defiance of Papal authority at this juncture, arose from no hate of the Romish
dogmas nor from any love of the new religion. He carried out all his schemes
solely from political motives; the religious, the emotional side<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
left him absolutely untouched; the practical, the politically serviceable aspect
of the case, alone appealed to him.</p>

<p>Popular as Henry doubtless was, Cromwell must have realized, when he thus
threw himself heart and soul on the King’s side in the divorce case, that he had
staked everything on the continuance of the royal favour. The best of the clergy
were strongly against the cause of Anne Boleyn, and there were but few who disagreed
with them. The general sympathy of the nation for Katherine was greater than ever.
Chapuys tells us that Henry was urged by the crowd in the streets to take back the
Queen, and that Anne Boleyn was not infrequently publicly insulted<a id="FNanchor_208_208"/><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>.
The mob, and still more the friars, spoke of her openly as a common prostitute,
who ‘ruled the King and beggared spiritualty and temporalty also.’ A letter of the
imperial ambassador tells us that the provincial of the Friars Observants at
Greenwich (better known as Friar Peto) preached before the King, and told him that
‘the unbounded affection of princes and their false counsellors deprived them of
their knowledge of the truth, and that Henry was endangering his crown by his
marriage, for great and little were murmuring at it.’ The King concealed his
vexation as best he could, but later ordered one of his chaplains to preach there
in his presence, and contradict all that Peto had said. At the end of this sermon
the warden arose, and answering for his minister in his absence, dared to say in
Henry’s presence that the royal chaplain had lied. The King was very angry and had
the warden and preacher both arrested<a id="FNanchor_209_209"/><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>.
Most of the Greenwich friars were eager to stand by their brethren, but some
proved less incorruptible, and gave secret information against the steadfast ones.</p>

<p>The result of all these murmurings among commons and friars was that Cromwell
 was kept very busy in finding out and extirpating ‘sedycyous opynyons’ as they
were termed. In order to clinch the advantages that were to accrue to Henry as a
result of his newly-assumed ecclesiastical position, it was as necessary to discover
and either destroy or convert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the laymen opposed to it, as it was to keep in submission the clergy from whose
hands it had been snatched. Henry could have probably found no abler man in the
realm to accomplish this purpose than his new minister. Early in 1532 Cromwell
began to create a system of espionage, the most effective that England had ever
seen, that in a short time was to render unsafe the most guarded expression of
dissent in politics or religion. The success which this organized method of reporting
treason later obtained, is one of the most striking proofs of the relentless
energy of its originator. But Cromwell’s efforts to extirpate sedition, and to
encourage the new ecclesiastical system, were not confined to England alone during
these first years of his ministry. The years 1531 and 1532 must not be passed over
without some slight reference to his connexion with William Tyndale. There was no
counsellor about the King, upon whom Cromwell could rely as an intelligent and
consistent ally, to help him carry out his schemes of ‘political Protestantism.’
In this dilemma he turned to William Tyndale, who was at that time in the Low
Countries. The theory of ‘one King, one law in the realm; no class of men exempt
from the temporal sword, no law except the law of the land’ advocated in ‘The
Obedience of a Christian Man,’ doubtless struck Cromwell, if he read the book. It
was perhaps the nearest approach he had yet found in writing to the policy he was
steadily pursuing; he immediately desired to induce the reformer to return to
England and to enlist him in the defence of his great cause. The fact that Cromwell
was able to persuade the King to permit him to attempt this is a good proof of his
influence with Henry. In May, 1530, Tyndale had been denounced as a perverter of
God’s word<a id="FNanchor_210_210"/><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>;
but so great was the change which the new minister’s accession to power had wrought
in the royal policy, that Henry now allowed Cromwell to write to his old friend
Stephen Vaughan in the Netherlands<a id="FNanchor_211_211"/><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>,
and commission him to try and discover where Tyndale was, and induce him to return
to England. To this request Vaughan sent a double reply to Henry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Cromwell, informing them that he had written to the reformer (three separate letters
to different places, not knowing where he was) and had received his answer, in
which Tyndale said that the news of what had lately happened in England made him
afraid to go there<a id="FNanchor_212_212"/><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.
In a confidential postscript to the letter to Cromwell, Vaughan writes in most
glowing terms about the reformer, saying that he was of far greater knowledge
than the King’s Highness took him for, as plainly appeared by his works. ‘Would
God he were in England.’ As usual Vaughan’s enthusiasm had run away with his
discretion. He was the exact opposite of Cromwell in this respect; he was ever
full of emotion and feeling, while his master was to the last degree practical and
calculating.</p>

<p>In spite of his first rebuff, Vaughan persevered in his attempts, and on the
25th of March sent Cromwell another letter, in which he expressed a little more hope
of getting Tyndale to go to England<a id="FNanchor_213_213"/><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.
Three weeks later his efforts received some more substantial reward, for on the
18th of April he wrote to Henry<a id="FNanchor_214_214"/><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>,
that he had at last obtained an interview with the reformer, and that though the
latter still refused to comply with his request, his words had been such as to
arouse the enthusiasm of Cromwell’s agent more than ever. With this letter Vaughan
sent to Henry the manuscript of Tyndale’s new book against Sir Thomas More, called
the Answer, which the reformer did not wish to put in print till Henry had seen it,
because the latter had been displeased at the hasty and unlicensed printing of his
former work, The Practise of Prelates. The letter and the book were not destined,
however, to have the desired effect on the King. The Answer was sufficiently plain
to indicate that Tyndale’s religious beliefs were not of the sort that would ever
be serviceable to Henry; the reformer was altogether too full of Protestantism for
its own sake, to suit either the King or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
his counsellor. For once Cromwell had mistaken his man. To say that the King was
thoroughly vexed and annoyed, when he had perused Vaughan’s letter, and the enclosed
work, is a mild statement of the facts. The original letter which Vaughan wrote is
not extant, but there is a copy of it in the British Museum which ends most abruptly
with the words ‘To declar<i>e</i> to yo<i>ur</i> Magyste what In my pore Judgement
I thynke of the man, I ass<i>er</i>teyne yo<i>ur</i> grace I haue not co<i>m</i>munyd
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> A man<a id="FNanchor_215_215"/><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>’;
a fact which suggests the possibility that the irritable King vented his anger on
the unoffending sheet of paper, and tore it in two. The letter with which Cromwell,
at the King’s direction, replied to Vaughan, is a still surer index to the impression
which the latter’s report had produced on the King. What with the precipitation of
his emotional, enthusiastic, and unpractical friend, Cromwell must have been placed
in a very awkward position. The many corrections and interlineations in the draft
of the letter he wrote in reply to Vaughan, sufficiently reveal his great perplexity
and bewilderment<a id="FNanchor_216_216"/><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.
The subject-matter of the letter will speak for itself. The rage of the King is
vividly described, and Vaughan is repeatedly warned to abandon the reformer: but
in spite of everything he continued to attempt to persuade Tyndale to return. He
had two more fruitless interviews with the latter, described in his letters to Henry
of the 20th of May, and to Cromwell on the 19th of June<a id="FNanchor_217_217"/><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>,
and after that came back to England for the summer. In November he returned to the
Netherlands, and wrote again to Cromwell warmly on Tyndale’s behalf, but not a
word did he receive in reply<a id="FNanchor_218_218"/><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.
In the meantime Henry and Cromwell had dispatched Sir Thomas Elyot to arrest the
reformer and bring him home<a id="FNanchor_219_219"/><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>.
Vaughan finally saw the danger he ran in advocating the cause of the author of the
‘venemous and pestif<i>er</i>ous work<i>es</i>,’ and dared say no more. The rest
of his letters during these two years do not even once mention him. The whole
Tyndale episode is noteworthy as the nearest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
approach to a mistake in Cromwell’s internal policy. Henry’s anger probably gave
him a clear warning that many more such would bring him to certain ruin. He was
saved from serious consequences in this case, only because he had amply atoned
for it by his brilliant success in obtaining the submission of the clergy.</p>

<p>Cromwell was also occupied, during these two years, in re-establishing Wolsey’s
foundation at Oxford, under the new name of King Henry the Eighth’s College. He
was appointed receiver-general and supervisor of all the lands belonging to it;
and the adjustment of claims, transfer of property, new foundation and charter
kept him very busy, and gave him an excellent opportunity to display his legal
talent. He also superintended the building of a new palace at Westminster, regulated
the wages of the men working on the fortifications at Calais, and was also busy
with minor duties in the King’s own household—the care of the royal plate and
jewels, and even the drawing of patterns for Henry’s robes of state<a id="FNanchor_220_220"/><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>.
From the close of the year 1529 until his fall, the best index to the various
occupations in which he was engaged is afforded by his famous ‘remembrances.’
These consist largely of short and usually incomplete sentences, sometimes even
single words, jotted down at odd moments by Cromwell or his chief clerk, on loose
sheets of paper—often on the backs of letters and drafts of important documents.
They are for the most part absolutely disjointed and unconnected in matter, form,
and handwriting. Sandwiched in between apparently careless phrases which later
expand into the most drastic of parliamentary enactments, we find minute details
concerning the wages of labourers, the cost of New Year’s presents at the Court,
or even matters of a private nature: next to a memorandum for the signing of a
letter for some Spaniards occur the significant words, ‘To Remembre the Auncyent
Cronycle of magna Carta and how <i>libera sit</i> Cam into the Statute<a id="FNanchor_221_221"/><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.’
The less important items are of course by far the more numerous, especially in the
first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> six years when the
King loaded his new minister with details of the greatest variety and complexity.
Towards the last the ‘remembrances’ are fewer in number, and deal less extensively
with minor matters; but even up to the very end we find ample evidence that the
King’s minister carried in his head an amount of detail of a comparatively unimportant
nature, which would have been quite impossible for a man like his predecessor.
The Cardinal, absorbed in studying the great diplomatic combinations of continental
Europe, had shamefully neglected minor affairs at home. Cromwell, in his ten
years of power, not only atoned for the errors of Wolsey, but also familiarized
himself with every detail of domestic administration to an extent that no King or
minister had ever done in England before. It would have been almost impossible to
carry through the tremendous changes which had followed the divorce, without the
aid of a counsellor of the peculiar talents of Thomas Cromwell.</p>

<p>The thread of our narrative now becomes so complicated, when the new minister
is at last fully installed in the King’s service, that it will be necessary to
depart from the chronological order of events hitherto followed, and to treat
separately each phase of Cromwell’s policy, up to the reaction of 1539. The
Internal and Foreign Administration, Suppression of the Monasteries, of the
Pilgrimage of Grace, &amp;c., all move on hand in hand, and in order to understand
their bearing on one another, it is only needful to remember that they were all
the work of one man, and were proceeding in general at the same time.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE SUPPLICATION OF THE COMMONS AGAINST THE ORDINARIES.</p>

<p class="mbot1">Four drafts of this petition exist to-day in the Public Record Office. One of
them is written in a hand which may be recognized in the greater part of Cromwell’s
correspondence of the time, and which is probably that of his chief clerk; it is
corrected and revised by Cromwell himself. Of the other three, one, which is
uncorrected and probably a final draft, is also written by the clerk—and the other
two, chiefly in a strange handwriting, are filled with interlineations by Cromwell.
The following copy was made from the first of these drafts (Cal. v, 1016 (4)). The
words in brackets are crossed out in the original manuscript: the words in italics

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">INTERNAL POLICY</p>

<p>From the close of the year 1532 until his fall, the entire domestic administration
of England was in Cromwell’s hands. From the moment that he entered the King’s
service he had definitely committed himself to the policy which he was to follow
till the end of his days. His own theories of internal government, the traditions
of the Tudor monarchy, and the situation of the realm at the time of his accession
to power, combined to convince him that the maintenance of an all-powerful kingship
was indispensable to England’s safety; the nature of the proposal by which he
first won Henry’s confidence was tantamount to an irrevocable declaration of that
principle, and a promise that it should be the guiding thought of his entire
administration. The revolt from Rome was an incident rather than an aim of his
policy. He had suggested it at first as offering the only possible solution of the
immediate difficulties of the Crown, and as affording golden opportunities for the
increase of the power of the monarchy; but as soon as the decisive step had been
taken, he saw that the security of his own position had become conditional upon
the permanence of the new ecclesiastical system, which in turn could only be ensured
if the King, for whose sake it had been created, was rendered supreme in Church
and State. Cromwell’s very existence had thus become dependent on the success of
his endeavours to maintain and carry further the policy initiated by Henry VII.,
and to elevate the Crown to sovereign power above every other institution in the
realm. Perhaps no minister has ever had more varied problems to confront him, than
those which Cromwell had to deal with during these eight years; and yet his action
in every case is a logical, intelligent application of the theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of internal government, which he believed was the only sure road to national
greatness. With this great principle firmly borne in mind, the history of Cromwell’s
domestic administration becomes comparatively simple.</p>

<p>A further assertion of the Supremacy of the Crown in ecclesiastical affairs was
necessary, before Cromwell could attempt to strengthen its already predominant
position in the State. The chief object of the more important measures of the
years 1533 and 1534 was to utilize the consequences of the breach with Rome for
the benefit of the monarchy, and to provide that none of the power of which the
Pope had been deprived should be permitted to escape the King. During the year
1532 Henry had deluded himself with hopes that his first attack on the liberties
of the English clergy might frighten Clement into acquiescence in the divorce, but
at last his patience came to an end, and he surrendered himself entirely to the
guidance of Cromwell, who had been persuaded from the first that nothing further
was to be obtained from the Pope. In January, 1533, the King was secretly married
to Anne Boleyn; on the 10th of May Cranmer, who had lately been raised to the see
of Canterbury, opened his archiepiscopal court at Dunstable<a id="FNanchor_222_222"/><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>.
With a promptitude which must have been highly satisfactory to Henry after the
delays of the previous proceedings at Rome, the sentence of divorce was pronounced.
There can be little doubt that Cromwell gave efficient aid in hastening the
verdict<a id="FNanchor_223_223"/><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>;
but what is far more important, he took effective measures, even before it was
rendered, to prevent its revocation. Parliament had been in session during the
three months previous to the assembling of the court at Dunstable: in anticipation
of the coming sentence, it had been induced to pass an Act<a id="FNanchor_224_224"/><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
to deprive Katherine of the only hope that remained to her by forbidding appeals
to Rome, and by ordaining that the decision of an archiepiscopal court should be
final, except in cases where the King was concerned, when appeal might be made to
the Upper House of Convocation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
A notable effort was made to conceal the obvious and immediate purpose of this
statute under a shroud of pious and patriotic verbiage. The life of the Act, however,
was but short. Though it had dealt the death blow to the jurisdiction of the Pope
in England, it had not made adequate provision for the maintenance of the Supremacy
of the Crown; so in 1534 the statute of the previous year was superseded by a new
one<a id="FNanchor_225_225"/><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>,
which enacted that an appeal might always be made from an archbishop’s court to
the King’s Court of Chancery, the decision of which was to be final. The abolition
of the Annates (which will be considered in another place) occurred at the same
time. The effect of these two measures was to complete the work begun in 1530, and
to sever the last links of the chain which bound the Church of England to Rome.</p>

<p>In the meantime the famous Act of Succession<a id="FNanchor_226_226"/><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>,
bastardizing the Princess Mary and establishing the offspring of Anne Boleyn as
lawful heirs to the throne of England, had also been passed in Parliament, and
before the year had closed a new statute<a id="FNanchor_227_227"/><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
had formally recognized the King’s ecclesiastical supremacy for the third time;
for Henry was not satisfied with the acknowledgements he had wrung from the clergy
in 1531 and 1532, nor with the express assertion that the King was on earth Supreme
Head of the Church of England, contained in the oath to the new succession, which
Cromwell’s commissioners began to administer throughout the realm in the summer of
1534. The last vestige of the independence of the English bishops was also removed
in the course of this memorable year, by certain provisions of the final Act for
the restraint of Annates<a id="FNanchor_228_228"/><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.
It had not been necessary, however, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
introduce any very radical innovation here. The bishops were already virtually in
the King’s hands, for the elections by chapters had long been a mere farce, and
the royal nominee had been almost invariably chosen. So the Act had aimed at a
legalization of the <i>status quo</i>—merely adding a few new provisions to strengthen
the King’s hold on the Church. All relations with the Pope were of course to
cease; the bishops were to be consecrated by virtue of a royal commission; and if
the chapter failed to elect within twelve days, the King was empowered to fill the
vacancy by letters patent. But even this does not seem to have been enough to
satisfy Cromwell. A letter of Chapuys in the early part of 1535 informs us that
the King’s Secretary called some of the bishops before the Council to ask them if
the King could not make and unmake them at pleasure: ‘they were obliged to say yes,
else they should have been deprived of their dignities: as the said Cromwell told
a person, who reported it to me, and said that the Council had been summoned only
to entrap the bishops<a id="FNanchor_229_229"/><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.’
Cromwell followed this up, later in the year, by causing a Prohibitory Letter to
be sent out in the King’s name, forbidding the bishops to visit any monastery or
to exercise any right of jurisdiction during the visitation of the religious houses
then in progress<a id="FNanchor_230_230"/><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>.
It appears that even Cromwell, with all his audacity, was at a loss to devise a
means to silence the objections which were raised against this high-handed measure.
He was not ashamed to take a hint from the fertile brains of his two blood-hounds,
Legh and Ap-Rice, who suggested an ingenious argument to crush all opposition, the
gist of which is contained in the following quotation from a letter which they
wrote to Cromwell, Sept. 24, 1535<a id="FNanchor_231_231"/><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Yf they (the bishops) had any Jurisdiction, they muste ned<i>es</i> haue
receued <span class="larger">‹</span>it<span class="larger">›</span> either by

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></p>

<p>‘Yf they saye by the Lawe of god, Lett theym bring foorth sc<i>ri</i>ptur but

<p>‘Yf they saye by the busshop of Romes Authoritie. Lett theym exercise it still,

<p>‘Yf they saye by the Kinges permission why be they more discontent that the
king shuld call agein nowe to his hand<i>es</i> that which came from hym to theym,
than they wolde haue ben<i>e</i> yf he had never graunted it theym. And surely
they are not able to iustifie thexercise of their iurisdiction hetherto.’
Fortified by such reasoning as this did the Royal Supremacy pass into effect.</p>

</div>

<p>Having thus obtained the complete submission of the greater lights of the Church,
Cromwell consistently pursued his relentless policy with the humbler orders of friars
and monks. His method of dealing with the latter did not differ materially from his
policy with the former, except that it was perhaps more sanguinary. Priors Lawrence
and Webster, two Carthusians who denied the validity of the King’s new title, were
examined by Cromwell, and when they stubbornly refused to retract their assertions,
they were promptly sentenced and executed<a id="FNanchor_232_232"/><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>.
Three others, Houghton, Hale, and Reynolds, suffered death a little later, and the
latter dared to tell Cromwell that in spite of the terror he had caused by his late
proceedings, all good men in the kingdom really held the same opinion, that the Headship
of the Church was not the King’s<a id="FNanchor_233_233"/><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>.
But notwithstanding the wide popular dissatisfaction at the new measures, most malcontents,
both lay and spiritual, kept their thoughts to themselves. Men were beginning to
discover how dangerous it was to criticize the doings of the King and his minister.
The elaborate system of espionage and the commissions to seek out and punish
treason, which Cromwell had so laboriously established all over the country in
1532, had now begun to bear fruit. It was impossible to tell who the government
spies were: impossible to know when or against whom the next accusation would be
made. The words which men spoke in the bosom of their families or to their most
intimate friends and neighbours were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as likely to be laid to their charge as their utterances in public: harmless,
obscure and ignorant country folk were brought before the magistrates as often as
those of higher degree. Edmond Brocke, husbandman, eighty years of age, of Crowle
in Worcestershire, was walking home in the rain from Worcester market on the
Saturday before St. Thomas’ Day, in company with Margaret Higons. ‘Yt ys long of
the Kyng that this wedre is so troblous or vnstable,’ he said, ‘and I wene we shall
nevir haue bett<i>er</i> wedre whillis the Kinge Reigneth, and therefore it makith
no matt<i>er</i> if he were knocked or patted on the heed<a id="FNanchor_234_234"/><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>.’
These facts were declared on August 12, 1535, before John Russell Esq., Justice of
the Peace, by Richard Fulke, husbandman, and Joan Danyell of Crowle. Brocke
confessed that he had said ‘that it was a hevy and grevous wether and that there
was neuyr good wedring<i>es</i> sithins the King began this busines,’ but what he
meant by ‘busines’ he could not tell: as to the rest of his words, he said, he was
mad or drunk if he spoke them—more than this he would not answer. William Ferrall,
of Eastbourne in Sussex, deposed before Sir John Gage on August 14, 1536, that Sir
William Hoo, vicar of Eastbourne, and suffragan of the diocese of Chichester,
walking with him in the churchyard, said that ‘they that rule about the King make
him great bankett<i>es</i> and geve him swete wynes and make him dronke,’ and that
then ‘they bring him byllis and he puttyth his sign to them whereby they doo what
they will and no man may Correcte them<a id="FNanchor_235_235"/><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.’
Margaret Chanseler, of Senklers Bradfeld in Suffolk, spinster, was forced to
confess before Sir Robert Drury in February, 1535, that, when drunk and under the
influence of an evil spirit, she had said, in presence of Edmond Tyllet and
Anthony Harward, ‘that the quenes g<i>ra</i>ce had on<i>e</i> child by our sou<i>er</i>eigne
lorde the Kynge, which the seid <span class="larger">‹</span>child<span class="larger">›</span>
was ded borne, &amp; she p<i>ra</i>yed god that she myght neuer haue other; also
that the quen<i>e</i>s g<i>ra</i>ce was a noughtty hoore &amp; that the Kyng<i>es</i>
grace ought not to mary within his realme.’ Tyllet and Harward, when summoned,
made the matter somewhat worse. They declared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
that the spinster had called the Queen ‘a goggyll yed hoore,’ and that she had
added ‘God save queen Katteryn for she was ryghtuous queen, &amp; that she trusted
to see her queen Ageyn &amp; that she should warrant the same<a id="FNanchor_236_236"/><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>.’
All the magistrates before whom these depositions were laid, received ample
instructions from Cromwell how to deal with every case; if the accusation was very
heavy, the offender was usually sent up to the minister himself, to answer for his
misdeeds at head quarters. The punishments in these cases were very severe: there
are almost no records of the penalties inflicted on those against whom the depositions
were brought, but there is reason to believe that comparatively slight misdemeanours
were not seldom rewarded with death.</p>

<p>But of all the devices ‘For the putting the Kyng<i>es</i> subiect<i>es</i> and
other in more terroure,’ as Cromwell once expressed it<a id="FNanchor_237_237"/><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>,
the most ruthless remains to be mentioned. The execution of the Carthusians had
had its effect, but Cromwell was persuaded that more blood would have to be
spilled before his victory could be considered complete. As was usual with him,
he laid the axe at the root of the tree, and chose as his victims the noblest and
foremost in the land. The opinions of Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More were well
known to be opposed to the Royal Supremacy, and as such they carried enormous
weight. Cromwell must have seen that it would be impossible to establish the King
in his new position with any security, until these two men were either converted
or destroyed. So, never once swerving from his purpose, nor letting the rank and
position of these distinguished men change or deter him, he set about the business
of ‘making or marring,’ with his usual directness and method. If he knew More and
Fisher at all well, he must have been reasonably certain that he could never alter
their convictions, so it became necessary for him to look for some adequate pretext
for getting rid of them. Such a pretext soon presented itself.</p>

<p>In July, 1533, occurs the first mention of serious disturbance due to the
visions and prophecies of Elizabeth Barton, better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
known as the Nun of Kent<a id="FNanchor_238_238"/><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>.
Her reputation for holiness and for divine inspiration was so high throughout the
land, that her mad follies were everywhere regarded with almost superstitious
reverence. Cromwell, at the King’s command, caused her to be examined by Cranmer,
but apparently did not succeed in eliciting the information he desired, for the
investigation was continued by other interrogators who were less leniently disposed
than the Archbishop<a id="FNanchor_239_239"/><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>.
The Nun was finally obliged to confess that ‘she nev<i>er</i> Hadd Vision in all
her Lyff, but all that ever she said was fayned of her owne ymagynac<i>i</i>on,
only to satisfie the Myndeis of theym Whiche Resorted vnto her, and to obtayn
worldly prayse<a id="FNanchor_240_240"/><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>.’
She and her accomplices were forced to read their public confessions on a scaffold
erected at Paul’s Cross, while a sermon was preached in denunciation of the fraud.
In the following spring she was condemned to death in Parliament, and in April she
was executed with some of her accomplices at Tyburn<a id="FNanchor_241_241"/><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>.</p>

<p>But the destruction of the Nun was only of secondary importance for Cromwell’s
plans; he was mainly looking for some mesh in which he could entrap others of whom
he was in much more fear than Elizabeth Barton. Every effort appears to have been
made to elicit from her a confession of communication with the divorced Queen, but
without success. More and Fisher, however, were not destined to escape so easily.
Because the Bishop of Rochester, after several interviews with the unhappy woman,
had not reported to Henry her disloyal prophecies (which the Nun had already made
in presence of the King himself), it was taken as a sign of treason and neglect of
duty to the sovereign. The long letter which Cromwell wrote to Fisher in February,
1534, gives a detailed account of the numerous and unfounded charges against him<a id="FNanchor_242_242"/><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>.
This letter impresses the reader as having been written <i>pro forma</i> only.
Cromwell must have realized that he could never hope to overcome two men who were
so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> much his intellectual
superiors as More and Fisher, in an argument. He therefore carefully avoided having
any conversation with them, and wrote to them only in order to have some slight
outward justification for his arbitrary action. Fisher sent pathetic letters to
the King and the Lords, when Cromwell refused to accept his excuses or listen to
his arguments, but in vain. His name was included in the Act of attainder of Elizabeth
Barton and her accomplices which was passed in March, 1534, but his life was spared
until the King could find a more valid pretext for actually destroying him<a id="FNanchor_243_243"/><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>The accusations in the case of Sir Thomas More were even more groundless than
in Fisher’s. The only charges that could be proved against him were an unimportant
interview with the Nun herself, a letter which he confessed to have written to her,
warning her to leave political subjects entirely alone, and an insignificant
conversation about her with a certain father Resbye, Friar Observant of
Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_244_244"/><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>.
So much was made of these slight accusations, however, that More was forced to
write a long letter of excuse to Cromwell. His explanations about the Nun and
about his attitude on the Papal Supremacy appear to have been satisfactory; when
he was examined by Cromwell and Audeley, all the inventiveness of his accusers
seemed to be used to no purpose. ‘As the King did not find,’ says Chapuys, ‘as it
seems he hoped, an occasion for doing him more harm, he has taken away his salary<a id="FNanchor_245_245"/><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>.’
But this unfortunately was not destined to be the end of the affair; if the King
was not determined on the ex-Chancellor’s destruction, his Privy Councillor was;
but Cromwell was forced to bide his time and wait for a better opportunity, so
that further proceedings were stayed until the following April.</p>

<p>In the meantime the new Act of Succession had been passed in Parliament, and
the oath of allegiance which it required was promptly tendered to More and Fisher,
who finally consented to swear to the statute itself but not the preamble<a id="FNanchor_246_246"/><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>.
They were unwilling to give their reasons for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
rejecting the latter, but Cranmer cannot have been far wrong when he wrote to
Cromwell that the cause of their refusal to accept it lay in its attacks on the
authority of the Pope and the validity of the King’s first marriage<a id="FNanchor_247_247"/><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.
The Archbishop, ever on the side of humanity, urged the King’s minister to accept
the compromise which More and Fisher offered, but in vain. The ex-Chancellor and
the aged bishop were committed to the Tower, which they never quitted again. For
more than a year they remained there subjected to every sort of indignity, until
on May 5, 1535, they were summoned by the King, and told that unless they swore to
the Act of Succession and the Royal Supremacy, they would be treated no better
than the Carthusian monks who had lately been executed<a id="FNanchor_248_248"/><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>.
They were allowed six weeks for reflection, but they replied that they would not
change their opinion in six hundred years, if they lived so long. So strong was
the popular feeling however, that it is doubtful if Henry would have dared to
execute Fisher, simply because he said that ‘the King, our sovereign Lord, is not
Supreme Head of the Church of England’; but when it was announced that the Pope,
at a consistory held May 20, had created him a Cardinal, the King was so enraged
that he threw all caution to the winds. He declared in his fury that ‘he would
give Fisher another hat, and send his head to Rome for the Cardinal’s hat afterwards,’
and ordered both his prisoners to swear to his ecclesiastical headship before St.
John’s Day, or suffer punishment as traitors<a id="FNanchor_249_249"/><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.
Cromwell had endeavoured from the beginning to keep up the appearance of being
reluctant to punish the aged bishop and his noble companion, and there is record
that when he heard of the latter’s first refusal to abandon his beliefs, ‘he sware
a great oath<a id="FNanchor_250_250"/><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>.’
But in spite of this there is every reason to think that he was the true cause of
the ex-Chancellor’s death. It is not likely that Henry would have consented to
the execution of a man whom he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had formerly loved and respected as much as More, unless his counsellor had
poisoned his heart against him. Moreover, the mentions of More and Fisher in
Cromwell’s ‘remembrances’ are so frequent and of such a character, as to leave
little doubt that he had determined to ruin them from the first. They both
suffered death by beheading in the summer of 1535<a id="FNanchor_251_251"/><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.
It was a terrible evidence of the ruthlessness of the forward policy to which
Henry had now committed himself by the advice of his new minister. The most
brilliant and cultivated Englishman of the time had been brought to the block to
bear testimony to the King’s relentless anger; the gentleness and humility of the
oldest prelate in the realm had not shielded him from Henry’s wrath and the swift,
passionless blow of his all-powerful agent. Terror had mastered the country, and
men wondered what the end would be<a id="FNanchor_252_252"/><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>.</p>

<p>But though Cromwell’s truculent measures had gained the day in England, they
excited the anger and horror of continental Europe. Sentence of excommunication
had been passed on Henry in the summer of 1534; public opinion would not have
permitted the Pope longer to postpone the final blow, even if he had wished to do
so. It now became more than ever necessary to defend the position of the King, and
Cromwell was busily occupied in filling the pulpit at Paul’s Cross with preachers
who were willing and able to expound the word of God to Henry’s profit and
advantage<a id="FNanchor_253_253"/><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.
In this he was greatly helped by Bishop Rowland Lee of Coventry and Lichfield,
who later played such an important part in connexion with the subjugation of Wales.
In seeking means to defend the Royal Supremacy Cromwell’s knowledge of the law
stood him in good stead. In a letter written in the year 1538, Sir Thomas Denys
tells how Cromwell three years earlier had advised him to ‘rede in a boke called
Bratton<a id="FNanchor_254_254"/><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
nott vnwrittyn this cccc yer<i>es</i> where he doth call the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
King<i>es</i> Grace <i>Vicarius Christi</i>, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> wherfor,’ he continues, ‘I do
rekyn a papiste and a traito<i>ur</i> to be one thing<a id="FNanchor_255_255"/><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>.’
But the most drastic of the measures which Cromwell adopted to strengthen the
power of the Crown was the famous Act about Proclamations, which he was able to
force the Lords and Commons to pass in 1539. By this statute, all Proclamations
made by the King and Council were given the force of Acts passed in Parliament,
save when they touched the subject’s lives, lands, goods, or liberties, or
infringed the established laws; and these exceptions were expressly declared
inapplicable to those who should disobey proclamations concerning heresy. Cromwell
had planned for the passage of this statute from a period at least as early as
1535. A letter<a id="FNanchor_256_256"/><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
which he wrote to Norfolk in July of that year affords us interesting information
concerning the origin of the measure. In a controversy about the best means of
preventing the export of coin from the realm, the Chief Justice had delivered the
opinion that ‘For the avoyding of any suche daungers <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> proclamacyons and
polyces so deuysyd by the King &amp; his cownsayll for any such purpose sholde be
of as good effect as Any law made by parlyament or otherwyse<a id="FNanchor_257_257"/><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>.’
The Chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> Justice probably
came to this decision at a hint from Cromwell; in any case the latter saw that the
good work which had been already begun could not be considered complete until the
opinion expressed had been given legal form. From this time onward there occur in
his ‘remembrances’ frequent mentions of an Act to be passed in Parliament to this
effect, but the measure proposed was so radical, that with all his energy and
unscrupulousness, it was four years before he was able to carry it through<a id="FNanchor_258_258"/><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to state that a legislative body which could be forced
to consent to such a statute as this retained in practice but few traces of that
independence of the Crown which it theoretically possessed. The passage of the Act
about Proclamations marks the culmination of a process begun long before Cromwell
came into power, but only perfected at the close of his ministry, by which the
subserviency of Parliament to the royal will was secured. But though the system
did not reach its highest development until 1539, the earlier years of Cromwell’s
administration show such an advance over that of his predecessor in this particular,
that we are justified in regarding the entire period of his ministry as the golden
age of Tudor despotism. From the time that the Commons permitted the King and his
counsellor to force on them the petition against the clergy in 1532, it is scarcely
too much to say that the sole function of Parliament was to register the decrees
which emanated from the royal council chamber.</p>

<p>Of course in order to render Parliament as ‘tractable’ as it was, it became necessary
for Cromwell to regulate the choice of members for the King’s profit, and the success
of his endeavours in this direction is little short of marvellous. Royal interference
in elections was certainly not unknown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
before his time, but it had not attained the proportions which it was destined to
assume under Cromwell, and it was often strongly resented by the people. It was only
with ‘much difficulty,’ that Henry VII., in the year 1506, succeeded in forcing the
citizens of London to abandon the right to elect their own sheriff, which had been
granted them by the charter of Henry I.<a id="FNanchor_259_259"/><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>,
and to accept the royal nominee to that office<a id="FNanchor_260_260"/><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.
But thirty years later, the Crown had carried its encroachment on the popular liberties
so far that it seemed to be usually regarded as a matter of course that a royal nomination
should take the place of a fair election. If any protest was raised against Henry’s
palpable infringement of ancient rights—and this was very rarely the case—the King
and his minister affected to regard the complaint with a sort of indignant amazement.
Let us examine the details of an election in Canterbury, which took place when Cromwell
was at the height of his power. Writs had been issued for the choice of two members
to Parliament from that city in early May, 1536. Between eight and nine in the morning
of the eleventh of that month, the sheriff, John Hobbys, caused the commonalty of
Canterbury to assemble in the accustomed place, where John Starky and Christopher
Levyns were duly elected burgesses. After the voters had dispersed, about noon-time,
John Alcok, the mayor of Canterbury, came to Sheriff Hobbys in great perplexity, with
a letter from Cromwell and Audeley, which desired, on the King’s behalf, that Robert
Derknall and John Bryges ‘shulde fulfill the seid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
rom<i>es</i>.’ On the following morning the sheriff directed a humble letter to
Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_261_261"/><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>,
stating the facts, and begging that the election of Starky and Levyns might be
allowed to stand, as the King’s wishes were not known until too late; ‘if your
seid l<i>ette</i>re had come to me byfore the seid eleccion,’ he pleaded, ‘I wolde
haue done the best that had been in my powr to <span class="larger">‹</span>have<span class="larger">›</span>
Accomplished our Souereigne lord the King<i>es</i> pleasure and yo<i>ur</i>s in
the p<i>re</i>mysses.’ But the King’s minister gave no heed to the representations
of John Hobbys: the fact that an election had already been held did not trouble
him in the least: the King’s will was to be accomplished at all costs. On May 18
he addressed a significant letter to the Mayor and Burgesses of Canterbury, which
was quite sufficient to induce the recipients to nullify their former proceedings.
The phraseology of the letter is noteworthy: the King’s minister did not discuss
the fact that his first message had arrived too late. He simply reminded the burgesses
that the King’s pleasure had been signified to them, and that they ‘the same litle
or nothynge regardynge but rather co<i>n</i>temny<i>n</i>g’ had elected their own
candidates, according to their ‘owne wylles and myndes co<i>n</i>trarie to the
king<i>es</i> plesure and comandeme<i>n</i>t in that behalfe.’ This of course was
a thing whereat the King did ‘not a lytell marvell,’ and the burgesses were admonished
‘notwythstondynge the seyd elecc<i>i</i>on’ to ‘p<i>ro</i>cede to a new and electe
thosse other, accordyng to the tenure of the former l<i>ette</i>res’: they were
also desired to notify Cromwell at once ‘if any p<i>er</i>sone wyll obstynatly gaynsay
the same,’ so that the King’s minister might deal with the refractory burgess
according to his master’s pleasure. Two days later Mayor Alcok replied with the
following dutiful letter. ‘In humble Wise certefie you that the xx<sup>th</sup>

Such was the calm way in which parliamentary suffrage rights were made of no
effect and the King’s pleasure enforced. It is important to notice in this
connexion how careful Henry and Cromwell were to cloak their most unwarrantable
proceedings by the preservation of ostensible constitutionalism. Never was the now
farcical form of a fair election abandoned; never did the King fail outwardly to
observe those legal restrictions by which the Crown was supposedly fettered, and
the liberties of the nation theoretically preserved. The autocracy which Cromwell
had done so much to establish was carried on ‘within and upon the already existing
constitution,’ and the public protest was thus in great measure disarmed.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that the invaluable services which Cromwell rendered to the
Crown were rewarded by an almost exclusive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
enjoyment of the royal confidence, which enabled him soon to do almost what he
pleased with his two great rivals, Norfolk and Gardiner. At first he had cautiously
held himself aloof from these men, but now that he had outstripped them in the
King’s favour, his bearing towards them altered accordingly. It is a very significant
fact that in his ten years of service, he never left the King for any considerable
length of time, but often contrived to get Norfolk and Gardiner sent away—the one
to cope with internal troubles, the other to act as ambassador to France. Cromwell
succeeded in harassing them both while they were at Court, and in making them
abandon every pretence to consistency. Chapuys, in a letter of December 9, 1533,
tells us that Norfolk, hitherto the most pronounced of Catholics, uttered ‘a
thousand blasphemies’ against the Pope, even more shocking than those of the King,
calling him ‘an unhappy whoreson, a liar, and a wicked man; and that it should
cost him (Norfolk) wife and children <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and all that he possessed, or that he
would be revenged on him. He has a good deal changed his tune, for it was he <span class="nowrap">. . .</span>
who favoured most the authority of the Pope; but he must act in this way not to
lose his remaining influence, which apparently does not extend much further than
Cromwell wishes; for which  reason, I understand, he is wonderfully sick
of the Court<a id="FNanchor_263_263"/><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.’
In the spring of 1535 the Duke was forced to surrender entirely, and retire to
his estate at Kenninghall. Gardiner had to abandon the Secretaryship in 1534 in
Cromwell’s favour. The new minister tantalized him in much the same way as he did
Norfolk, and doubtless increased the enmity of the Bishop of Winchester, which he
had first incurred at the time of Wolsey’s fall, and which five years later was
to be such an important factor in effecting his own destruction.</p>

<p>Cromwell was perhaps the only man at the Court who, in the early days of his
ministry, had the least suspicion that Anne Boleyn might sometime lose the royal
favour. He was able to comprehend the King’s love for her better than anyone else,
and to discern that when the royal passion had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
been satisfied, Henry’s affection for his second wife would be a thing of the
past. The King’s chagrin that Anne had not brought him a male child, and the rage
awakened by her subsequent miscarriage could not have escaped him. From thenceforth
he must have become convinced that her ruin was ultimately certain, and he began
to throw out hints that he no longer wished to be reckoned among her adherents.
In April, 1536, it was notorious that there was a marked coolness between them,
and a month later a very unexpected turn in foreign affairs brought matters to a
head and forced him to take active measures against her, in order to save his own
reputation with the King<a id="FNanchor_264_264"/><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.
There is reason to think that he was the prime mover in the plot which led to her
arrest. He certainly worked against her at her trial, and was present at her
execution; in fact he took every possible step to forestall all chances of being
included in her fall. His sudden abandonment of one whom a few years before he had
done so much to support, should be enough to confute those who have seen in his
previous devotion to the cause of Anne Boleyn an evidence that he favoured the
Reformed faith. Anne was certainly a professed Protestant; she possessed the
English Bible and read it; but it was only because her Protestantism was temporarily
useful to Cromwell’s designs, which were to obtain for his master a divorce from
Katherine, that he identified himself with her party during the first years of his
ministry. When the divorce had been secured, and Henry had been declared Supreme
Head of the Church of England; when the love which Anne had once enjoyed had been
transferred to Jane Seymour, and Cromwell saw that to favour the cause of the
unhappy Queen in opposition to the King might mean ruin and disgrace, he deserted
her at once.</p>

<p>Nor can the fact that Cromwell’s name figures prominently in connexion with
the publication of the Ten Articles of 1536 be justly urged as a reason for
ascribing to him any real devotion to the cause of Protestantism. Now that
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> severance from Rome was
complete, the King and his minister saw that a definition of the faith of the
Church of England had become necessary, in order that the unity of the new
ecclesiastical system might be preserved. The Ten Articles of 1536 were adopted
to make good this deficiency. Circumstances had rendered them inevitable, and the
fact that Cromwell presented them to Convocation, and signed them first of all the
members proves nothing, except perhaps the importance of his ecclesiastical office.
The Ten Articles declared the Bible and the three Creeds to be the only Rule of
Faith: Penance, Baptism, and the Eucharist were kept as sacraments: the veneration
of saints, soliciting of their intercession, use of images, and the usual ceremonies
in the service, though still held to be highly profitable, and as such worthy to
be retained, were pronounced in themselves powerless to justify the soul<a id="FNanchor_265_265"/><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>.
But though the main aim of these Articles was doubtless to preserve the integrity
of the Church of England at home, the time and circumstances under which they were
published seem to indicate that they were also intended to serve a purpose abroad.
We shall hear of them in this connexion in another chapter.</p>

<p>Cromwell’s zeal for the publication of the Bible in English, and also his injunctions
to the clergy<a id="FNanchor_266_266"/><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>,
must in the same way be attributed to political rather than to religious motives.
He saw what a powerful weapon the Bible had become in the hands of the German Reformers,
and soon succeeded in forcing Convocation, on December 19, 1534, to present a petition
to the King for the suppression of treasonable books in the vulgar tongue, and for
a translation of the Scriptures into English<a id="FNanchor_267_267"/><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.
Less than two years later Cromwell’s efforts were rewarded by the appearance of
an edition of the Scriptures patched together ‘out of Douche<a id="FNanchor_268_268"/><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
and Latyn’ by his friend Miles Coverdale. There seems to have been a very general
impression current that all passages which might have been interpreted in favour
of Katherine, had purposely been rendered in the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
sense<a id="FNanchor_269_269"/><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.
But this version was soon destined to be superseded. The following year witnessed
the appearance of the edition which is usually known as Matthew’s Bible, and which
consisted of a combination of the translations of Tyndale and Coverdale. It
received the official sanction of Cromwell and Cranmer, but its life was almost
as short as that of its predecessor. In the autumn of 1537 Grafton and Whitchurch,
two London printers whose names had been connected with the previous editions,
received a licence from the King to publish a new version of the Bible at Paris,
where the facilities for carrying on their trade were better than in England<a id="FNanchor_270_270"/><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.
At first the work seems to have progressed with great success, and in September,
1538, the King’s minister, in anticipation of its speedy completion, issued
injunctions that a copy of it should be placed in every church at the cost of the
parson and the parishioners, and that no one was to be discouraged from reading
it: he advised, however, that ‘the explication of obscure plac<i>es</i>’ be
referred ‘to men of higher iugement in scripture<a id="FNanchor_271_271"/><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>.’
But Cromwell was a little premature with his injunctions. An unforeseen event
occurred, which made the immediate publication of the new edition impossible. The
Royal Inquisition had apparently got wind of the doings of Grafton and Whitchurch
at Paris, and just as the task was approaching completion, they and all their
subordinates, and the French printer at whose house the work was being carried on,
were suddenly cited to appear before the Inquisitor-General for the realm of
France<a id="FNanchor_272_272"/><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>.
The Englishmen made haste to escape, without even waiting to collect the
implements of their trade or the Bibles that had already been printed. Cromwell,
on hearing of the disaster, went with a piteous tale to the French ambassador,
telling him that he himself had contributed 600 marks towards the publication of
the Bible in Paris, and begging him to ask his master to permit the work to be
continued there, or at least to allow the copies already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
finished to be sent to England safely, and not to suffer the Inquisition to
confiscate them. But Francis replied that good things might be printed in England
as well as in France, but that bad things should never be permitted to be printed
in Paris, and he further refused to deliver up the copies already completed. He
was unable, however, to prevent the final accomplishment of the work in London in
1539<a id="FNanchor_273_273"/><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a>.
The new version, commonly known as the Great Bible, was the last authorized
translation completed in the reign of Henry VIII., but apparently great efforts
had to be made to prevent the publication of unlicensed editions. It was not long
before a royal commission was issued to Cromwell, commanding him, in order to
avoid diversity of translations, to see that no man printed any English Bible
during the next five years except persons deputed by himself<a id="FNanchor_274_274"/><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest point of Cromwell’s domestic administration was his financial
policy. He never forgot the promise he had made on entering the King’s service to
make Henry ‘the richest king that ever was in England,’ for he was shrewd enough to
see that a full treasury was the first essential to the attainment of the larger aim
of his policy, the establishment of a royal despotism. He skilfully contrived that
many of the measures of the earlier years of his ministry, primarily intended to
cut the bonds which held England to Rome, should also serve to increase the wealth
of the Crown. The most noteworthy and successful of these measures was the abolition
of the Annates. There can be little doubt that it was through Cromwell’s agency that
a supplication was addressed to the King early in the year 1532<a id="FNanchor_275_275"/><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
urging him to arrest the payment of First Fruits to the Papacy: ‘bokes of annates’
and remembrances concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
them are to be found in large numbers among the minister’s letters and papers<a id="FNanchor_276_276"/><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>,
and the petition by which the measure to abolish the First Fruits was initiated was
a method especially characteristic of him, reminding us in many respects of the
way in which the independence of the clergy had been attacked but a short time
before. But the King was very cautious in granting the request, which had thus
been laid before him. He had not yet given up all hope of a peaceful solution of
his difficulty with the Pope, and was not yet prepared, as Cromwell was, openly
to defy the Holy See. So at first he determined to try the effect of a threat. The
immediate result of Cromwell’s efforts was the passage in Parliament of an Act<a id="FNanchor_277_277"/><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
which abolished Annates, but preserved to the Holy See certain payments on bulls
obtained for the election of bishops: the ratification of this statute by the
Crown, however, was expressly withheld, and the Act consequently remained inoperative,
while a post was sent to Rome ‘to frighten the Pope about the Annates<a id="FNanchor_278_278"/><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>.’
But this plan failed: Clement refused to be terrorized into submission; the King
became convinced that a complete break was inevitable, and, in July, 1533, the Act
was ratified and declared in force by letters patent<a id="FNanchor_279_279"/><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>.
The following year saw the passage of another statute, which abolished all the
payments preserved by the exceptions to the Act of 1532<a id="FNanchor_280_280"/><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>,
and a little later Parliament completed the work which Cromwell had forced it to
undertake by annexing the Annates to the Crown<a id="FNanchor_281_281"/><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>.
Supplementary to these statutes was the Act concerning Peter’s Pence and
Dispensations<a id="FNanchor_282_282"/><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>,
by which the Pope was deprived of all contributions that had not already been
arrested by the Acts about Annates. The use to which the rescued funds were put
is aptly described by a significant ‘remembrance’ of Cromwell’s to the effect
that ‘thenhabitaunt<i>es</i> and peple of this realme shall pay yerely vnto the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
kyng for ever, in lieu or stede of smoke pence, whiche they were wont to pay to
the busshop of rome, for eu<i>er</i>y hed or house a certayne small thyng for and
toward<i>es</i> the defense of thys Realme, whiche may be ymployed in makyng of
forteresses throughout the Realme<a id="FNanchor_283_283"/><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>.’
Another significant paragraph, from a letter of Chapuys to Charles V., of Dec. 19,
1534, reads as follows: ‘The King, besides the 30,000 pounds which he newly
obtained from the clergy, and an ordinary fifteenth from the laity, which was
granted him last year, and which may amount to 28,000 pounds, has just imposed a
tax by authority of Parliament, of the twentieth penny of all the goods of his
subjects, and that foreigners shall pay double, which will amount to a great sum.
These are devices of Cromwell, who boasts that he will make his master more wealthy
than all the other princes of Christendom: and he does not consider that by this
means he alienates the hearts of the subjects, who are enraged and in despair, but
they are so oppressed and cast down, that without foreign assistance it is no use
their complaining, and it will not be Cromwell’s fault, if they are not oppressed
further<a id="FNanchor_284_284"/><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a>.’</p>

<p>The King’s minister also appears to have been much occupied with the coinage.
He was constantly present at ‘assayes’ of gold and silver, and further took active
steps to stamp out the counterfeiters, of whom there appear to have been a great
number<a id="FNanchor_285_285"/><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>.
He caused a proclamation to be issued ‘for the false and clipped Coyne going in
this Realme with a greate punyshment to euery person that is founde with any false
or counterfeit moneye.’ The systematic debasement of the currency that disgraced
the reign of Henry VIII. had begun under Wolsey, but appears to have ceased entirely
during Cromwell’s ministry: it began again after Cromwell’s death, assuming far
greater proportions than before, and continued till the end<a id="FNanchor_286_286"/><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>.
That the King did not need to resort to such costly methods of replenishing his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
treasury while Cromwell was in power, bears eloquent testimony to the wisdom and
success of his minister’s finance. The latter’s efforts to prevent the ‘conveying
of coyne out of the realme’ shows that he saw the importance of securing plenty
of good coin for English trade, and that he did not want to create an artificial
cheapness. The statutes of Henry VII. forbidding the export of precious metals had
been renewed by his son in an Act passed in 1511, but this law had run out in
1523, and from that time onward there was no legal hindrance to the practice,
though the statutes enacted previous to Tudor times were still considered in
force<a id="FNanchor_287_287"/><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a>.
The result was that the earlier laws began to be transgressed, and Cromwell, in
devising methods to prevent further infringements of them, hit upon the expedient
of a royal proclamation, as we have already had occasion to notice.</p>

<p>Another most important measure passed during Cromwell’s ministry, was the so-called
Statute of Uses<a id="FNanchor_288_288"/><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>.
It was at the same time a legal and a financial reform. In order to evade the
common law, which prohibited testamentary disposition of landed property and
rendered it strictly subject to primogeniture, the custom had long been prevalent
that the owner should name before or at his death certain persons to whose ‘use’
his lands should be held. These persons became to all intents and purposes the true
devisees; for though the trustee, or ‘feoffee to uses,’ alone was recognized by
the common law, the beneficiary or ‘cestui que use’ soon began to receive strong
support through the equitable jurisdiction of the Chancellor, and so was often
able actually to enforce claims which originally had rested merely on moral obligation.
This was the usual method of circumventing the laws of the realm, in order to make
provision by will for younger children. In this particular it was perhaps legitimate,
but at the same time it opened the way to a great number of abuses, which are stated
at length in the preamble to the statute just mentioned. The chief of these were
the extraordinary complication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of titles to land, which resulted from the secret methods of devising it, and the
loss to the King and the great lords of the feudal dues on successions, wardships,
and marriages. Two ineffectual attempts had been made to remedy these evils in the
reigns of Richard III. and Henry VII.<a id="FNanchor_289_289"/><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>,
and at Cromwell’s accession to power the subject was brought up again. There is
reason to think that the Statute of Uses was under consideration as early as 1531,
and the main principle of it bears a close resemblance to the measure devised in
the reign of Richard III. A mention of it occurs in Cromwell’s ‘remembrances’ of
the year 1535<a id="FNanchor_290_290"/><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>,
but it was not finally passed until 1536, probably on account of the popular
opposition, which, according to Chapuys, was very pronounced. The upshot of the
statute was, that all right to the estate was taken from the grantee to uses and
vested in the beneficiary, and the distinction between legal and beneficial ownership
was thus entirely destroyed. The ostensible tenant was made in every case the
legal tenant; those entitled to the use of land became the actual holders of it.
The Act further was intended to abolish the right to create further uses in the
future: the power of disposing of interests in land by will was thus removed, and
the King was restored to the enjoyment of his ancient feudal dues.</p>

<p>Beyond the casual mention in his ‘remembrances<a id="FNanchor_291_291"/><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>’
there is no precise record of Cromwell’s connexion with this important measure.
It is worthy of note, however, that the attainments needed to plan and draft such
a statute were precisely those which Cromwell possessed in the very highest degree—intimate
knowledge of the law, and great shrewdness in finance. The bold and effective way
in which the measure struck at the root of the evil, and caused the extra-legal
practice which had grown up to become its own ruin, is very characteristic of him.
Furthermore, Cromwell was certainly believed to be the originator of the measure
by the rebels in the Pilgrimage of Grace, which was partially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
caused by it, and as such his death was demanded. It therefore seems highly probable
that it was he who devised this scheme in order to deal the death blow to a very
annoying practice of evading the law, and to enrich the royal treasury. The statute,
however, was not entirely successful in attaining the ends at which it aimed, for
by a strained interpretation of the letter of the Act, the courts managed to evade
the spirit of it, so that it failed to do away with the old distinction between
beneficial and legal ownership, which it had been intended to destroy. In addition
to this, the popular outburst of indignation aroused by the Statute of Uses was so
strong that a few months before Cromwell’s death he saw the actual right of at
least partial testamentary disposition of landed property obtained by the people.
The Act concerning the willing of land by testament<a id="FNanchor_292_292"/><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>,
passed in the spring of 1540, gave to every tenant in fee simple the right to
bequeath at his pleasure all lands which he held by socage tenure, and two-thirds
of the lands which he held by knight-service. The force of usage was such that
when the King and Cromwell attempted to abolish a practice, which had rendered the
willing of land possible under another name, the actual right to bequeath landed
property without circumventing the law was wrested from them.</p>

<p>The King was glad to entrust his capable adviser with the preservation of that
advantageous commercial position which had been won for England through the masterful
policy of Henry VII. Cromwell’s varied experience in foreign markets and his intimate
knowledge of all the details of the wool-trade, which was by far the most important
element of English commerce, had taught him in his earlier years many lessons of
which the whole nation was to reap the benefit. In general his administration witnessed
but few departures from the highly successful commercial policy inaugurated by the
first Tudor. His aim was rather to strengthen the advantages already gained, and
to increase the security of English commerce and industry against the competition
of continental rivals, than to attempt any radical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
innovations. The monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean which Venice had enjoyed
in Lancastrian times, had been a serious menace to the interests of the English merchants;
but the Italian wars had now almost totally deprived the Republic of that prominent
political position which she had occupied at the beginning of the century, and with
the loss of her national greatness her commercial supremacy fell. The ancient privileges
which had been granted to Venetian merchants and galleys previous to Tudor times,
had been exchanged for a set of stringent enactments, which dealt a heavy blow to
her trade and shipping during the reign of Henry VII. Cromwell followed the same
policy, and further seized the favourable opportunity afforded by Venice’s decline
to foster the interests of English merchants in other parts of the Mediterranean<a id="FNanchor_293_293"/><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>.
With the towns of the Hanseatic League the case was slightly different. The extensive
privileges the merchants of the North German cities had enjoyed in earlier times,
had raised them to such a commanding position that the growth of English commerce
in the north was rendered well-nigh impossible. Henry VII.’s aim had been to overthrow
the supremacy of the Hanseatic League, by a gradual withdrawal of the concessions
which it had wrung from his predecessors. The early part of his son’s reign had witnessed
a continuation of this wise policy, but during Cromwell’s ministry an alliance which
the threatening situation on the Continent had led England to conclude with Lübeck,
necessitated a temporary cessation of the process of curtailing the privileges of
the Hanse merchants<a id="FNanchor_294_294"/><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>.
But the loud outcries of the people against the destructive competition of the
Germans were sufficient to prevent Cromwell from making any permanent stand in
their favour. Political necessity alone had induced him to postpone the complete
withdrawal of their privileges: he knew that the tendency of the times was
irresistibly against the Hanseatic towns, and he was perhaps the more willing to
grant them a few temporary concessions in that he realized that nothing could ever
raise them again to the position of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dangerous rivals to English trade. His foresight was justified by the event; the
process which Henry VII. had begun was completed by the fall of the Steelyard in
the reign of Elizabeth. A more difficult problem was presented by the Netherlands.
England and the Low Countries were commercially indispensable to each other; the
English wool-market in Flanders was the centre of the mercantile interests of both
nations. The merchants of the Netherlands, however, had contrived to get the
better of their English neighbours until the accession of the house of Tudor; but
the concessions which resulted from the temporary removals of the English wool-mart
from Antwerp to Calais by Henry VII., and the enormously advantageous commercial
treaty which that King was able to wring from the Archduke Philip when fortune had
thrown the latter into his hands in 1506, had completely altered the situation to
England’s profit<a id="FNanchor_295_295"/><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>.
The efforts of Henry VIII. and Wolsey had been directed towards preserving the
provisions of the agreement of 1506, the validity of which the Netherlanders were
of course unwilling to acknowledge. Cromwell went further than this; his administration
witnessed not only the maintenance and increase of all the advantages which his
predecessor had secured, but also the discussion of a plan for attaining complete
commercial independence of the Low Countries, by bringing home the English wool-mart
to London<a id="FNanchor_296_296"/><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a>.
This scheme was not carried through, owing to the unwillingness of the King to
offend the Emperor; but the news of the proposals for it was soon known in the
Netherlands, and was not without its effect there. The merchants of the Low Countries
were greatly alarmed lest they should lose the English trade, and instead of
opposing every move which their rivals made, now began to grant them all possible
concessions. The Emperor’s dread of alienating Henry also contributed to force
them to adopt a more conciliatory attitude than ever before, and it may be justly
said that at the close of Cromwell’s administration the mercantile relations of
England and the Netherlands were so regulated as to secure every advantage for the
former. Cromwell’s whole commercial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
policy was strongly influenced by his desire to increase and improve English
shipping, especially at the last, when an invasion was threatened from the
Continent<a id="FNanchor_297_297"/><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a>.
His ‘remembrances’ are filled with items for appropriations for building and
rigging vessels of various kinds, and for making and improving harbours<a id="FNanchor_298_298"/><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>.
He did his utmost to clear the Channel of pirates, and was diligent in writing
letters to demand restitution of goods taken from English merchants at sea<a id="FNanchor_299_299"/><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a>.
In 1540 he caused an Act to be passed for the ‘maintenance of the navy<a id="FNanchor_300_300"/><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a>’:
one of its provisions restricted the privileges conferred on all foreign merchants
by a proclamation in the previous year<a id="FNanchor_301_301"/><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
to those who transported their wares in English ships.</p>

<p>Throughout Cromwell’s ‘remembrances’ occur countless minor items dealing with
miscellaneous questions of internal reform. Memoranda for the building and improvement
of roads and highways, for bettering the state of the coast defences, and for the
regulation of the rates of wages, are especially numerous. In 1538 he aided Norfolk
in suppressing a sort of strike among the Wisbech shoemakers, who had agreed to
stop work unless their wages were raised from 15<i>d.</i> to 18<i>d.</i> per dozen
boots sewed<a id="FNanchor_302_302"/><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a>.
It is perhaps unnecessary to state that this strike was regarded as a revolt
against authority, and that the masters gained an easy victory over the men. Among
Cromwell’s injunctions to the clergy in 1538 is an order to keep parish registers
of births, marriages, and deaths<a id="FNanchor_303_303"/><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>.
Apparently this measure was intensely unpopular, especially in the south-west of
England, where people seem to have got the notion that ‘some charges more than
hath been in time past shall grow to them by this occasion of registering of these
things<a id="FNanchor_304_304"/><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>.’
Precisely what the immediate object of the injunction was it is difficult to
say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> though there is little
reason to think that the fears it aroused among the people of Cornwall and
Devonshire were realized. It has been grudgingly applauded by one writer, and
characterized as ‘an inadequate attempt to supply the loss of the registers of
various kinds which had been kept by the monks<a id="FNanchor_305_305"/><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>’;
but its inadequacy, however great, might well pass unmentioned, in the face of
the many benefits which later resulted from it. However unpopular the measure may
have been at the time, its author certainly deserves the thanks of posterity for
preserving a vast amount of valuable information which would otherwise have been lost.</p>

<p>A few words remain to be added concerning Cromwell’s zeal for the advancement
of learning. As his political schemes had caused him incidentally to take sides
with the Reformation, his object was to strengthen those who favoured the new
religion and opposed Rome. Education is necessary to reform; and Cromwell did not
intend to leave to ignorant men the task of carrying on the work he had begun. He
therefore took steps to see that the opportunities for learning were improved.
Among the injunctions which he issued to the clergy in 1536<a id="FNanchor_306_306"/><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>,
is a clause providing for an increased number of exhibitions at the schools and
the Universities, ‘to thintent that lerned men maye hereafter spring the more.’
His dealings with Oxford and Cambridge do not seem to have been very important,
although in June, 1535, he was appointed Chancellor of the latter in place of Fisher.
He appears to have been much occupied in suppressing the various quarrels that
constantly took place between the students and the townspeople, and the letters
which he wrote to the Magistrates of Cambridge deal for the most part with this
problem<a id="FNanchor_307_307"/><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>.
In October, 1535, the King appointed him Visitor to the University, and at the
same time promulgated nine injunctions in which he directed the Chancellor, Masters
and Scholars of Cambridge to abandon the ‘frivolous questions and obscure glosses’
of the schoolmen, to read and teach the Scriptures, and to swear to the Royal
Supremacy and the new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Succession<a id="FNanchor_308_308"/><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>.
Henry’s minister, as usual, was the instrument employed to see that the injunctions
were enforced. Of Cromwell’s relations to Oxford still less remains to be said.
There are letters from him concerning the admission of a President of Magdalen in
1535<a id="FNanchor_309_309"/><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>,
and the election of a Master of Balliol in 1539. The latter appears to have been a
most disreputable character, and Cromwell’s assertion that he was chosen without
‘any parcyalyte or corruptyon’ was certainly false<a id="FNanchor_310_310"/><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a>.
A very interesting but comparatively well-known report from the pen of Dr. Layton
gives us a vivid picture of the state of the University in 1535, and tells of the
foundation of several new lectures at the various colleges<a id="FNanchor_311_311"/><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a>.</p>

<p>As a reward for his success in the management of domestic affairs, the King
conferred on him the many dignities and titles which, in 1536, marked the height
of his power. He had been raised to the offices of Privy Councillor, Master of the
Jewels, Clerk of the Hanaper, and Master of the King’s Wards in 1531 and 1532. The
Chancellorship of the Exchequer had followed in 1533. He became Principal Secretary
to the King in 1534, Master of the Rolls in the same year, Vicar-general and
Visitor-general of the Monasteries in January, 1535, Lord Privy Seal, Vicegerent
of the King in Spirituals<a id="FNanchor_312_312"/><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
in July, 1536. He was also created Baron Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
of Okeham in the same month, and Knight of the Garter in August, 1537. During the
last seven years of his ministry he was granted no less than nineteen minor
offices, through which his income must have been very greatly increased<a id="FNanchor_313_313"/><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>.
Just prior to the outbreak of the Pilgrimage of Grace, Cromwell’s position was
almost that of a despot. He was supreme in Convocation, Privy Council, and Parliament;
he enjoyed paramount authority in the direction of internal affairs, and next to
the King was by far the most important man in the realm.</p>

<p>A letter of Chapuys in the summer of 1536<a id="FNanchor_314_314"/><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>,
soon after Anne Boleyn’s execution, tells us that it was even rumoured that
Cromwell might marry the Princess Mary, but the Imperial ambassador himself was
too shrewd to be misled by such an improbable report<a id="FNanchor_315_315"/><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a>.
Had Cromwell seriously entertained the idea of a union with the daughter of the
divorced Queen, he would scarcely have permitted himself to be made use of by the
King as an instrument for breaking down her resolution: he could scarcely have
written her such a brutal letter as that of June 10, 1536<a id="FNanchor_316_316"/><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>.
But the inequality in rank is certainly in itself sufficient proof of the absurdity
of the proposition. Cromwell was about the last man in the world to become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
reckless with success; he never for a moment forgot his low birth, and the
imprisonment of the brother of his rival the Duke of Norfolk for presuming to wed
the King’s niece was a warning of the danger of such a proceeding, which could
not have been lost on him<a id="FNanchor_317_317"/><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>.
If such a proposition were put forward at all, and we cannot believe that it was,
it could only have been as a pretext to prevent the Princess from leaving the
realm and joining with her cousin the Emperor in an attempt to dethrone the King.</p>

<p>Cromwell was certainly shrewd enough to see that he could never hope to marry
into a reigning house himself, but he was none the less anxious that his son
Gregory should wed such a wife as would enable him to found a noble family. In
April, 1533, Gregory had been taken from Cambridge, and sent to live with his
father’s friend Dr. Rowland Lee, with whom he appears to have spent a summer in
hunting<a id="FNanchor_318_318"/><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>.
In 1535 he came out into public life, and in 1539 he was summoned to Parliament as
a peer of the realm. Two years earlier he had been able to contract an advantageous
marriage with the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred, sister of Jane Seymour<a id="FNanchor_319_319"/><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a>.
This fortunate match must be attributed to his father’s influence, for Gregory
seems to have been entirely without ambition, and such an idea would never have
entered his mind; his father, on the contrary, was precisely the man to think of
it. The number of grants either made jointly to Cromwell and his son, or providing
for the succession of the latter at his father’s death<a id="FNanchor_320_320"/><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>,
corroborates the theory that the King’s great minister wished Gregory to be the
heir of all his possessions and emoluments as far as might be, and desired to
raise his family to a permanent position among the English nobility.</p>

<p>Of course Cromwell was obliged in large measure to abandon his private business
after he definitely entered the King’s service, but his new position brought him
far greater riches than he could possibly have amassed in his old occupations.
The various inventories of his goods indicate great wealth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
and prosperity. He gave costly New Year’s presents at the Court, and owned several
houses, all of them magnificently furnished<a id="FNanchor_321_321"/><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>.
After October, 1534, when he was made Master of the Rolls, his correspondence
shows him to have been constantly in residence at the Rolls House, where he held
his Court. Writing in 1535, the Prioress of Little Marlowe complained that so great
was the crowd of his visitors there, that it was impossible to gain access to
him<a id="FNanchor_322_322"/><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">IRELAND, WALES, SCOTLAND, CALAIS</p>

<p>Though Cromwell was so busily occupied in England itself, he was far from
neglecting the adjoining countries. The subjugation of Ireland, the pacification
of Scotland, and the reform of Wales and Calais, played a very important part in
his political programme. He plainly saw that the English King’s position could not
be regarded as secure while these countries remained in the state in which they
were at Wolsey’s fall, and he determined as soon as possible to deal with them in
such a way that they should cease to be a menace to the English Crown in the future.</p>

<p>When he entered the King’s service he probably found little difficulty in
persuading Henry that, in order firmly to establish his supremacy, he must take
Ireland in hand as he had never done before. Throughout Wolsey’s administration
the tranquillity of the country had been continually disturbed by the feuds of two
rival Anglo-Norman families, the Fitzgeralds under the Earl of Kildare, and the
Butlers under the Earl of Ormond. To repress these quarrels the Cardinal had taken
the office of Lord Deputy from the young Earl of Kildare, and created the Earl of
Surrey Lord Lieutenant. After a year’s hard service in Ireland, however, Surrey
was recalled at his own request, and the Deputyship devolved on Sir Piers Butler.
He in turn was forced to resign his office to his rival Kildare, who passed it on
to Sir William Skeffington of Leicestershire, just at the time of Wolsey’s fall<a id="FNanchor_323_323"/><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>.</p>

<p>The affairs of Ireland had naturally been thrown into confusion by these numerous
changes, and Cromwell became convinced that subjugation by the sword was absolutely
essential, before any attempt could be made to govern the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
country, or to draw revenues from it. This policy brought him into collision with
his rival Norfolk, but he seems to have succeeded in convincing the King of the
superiority of his plan to that of the Duke, whose idea had been to conciliate the
Irish chieftains, and to pacify rather than subjugate the country<a id="FNanchor_324_324"/><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>.</p>

<p>During his first two years in the King’s service, Cromwell was so busy in
establishing the Royal Supremacy, that he could not pay much attention to Irish
affairs. The three years of Skeffington’s administration, moreover, appear to have
been fairly quiet. In 1532, however, a change came. The Earl of Kildare, by
craftily misrepresenting Skeffington’s doings at the English Court, secured the
latter’s recall, and obtained for himself the post of Lord Deputy for the third
time<a id="FNanchor_325_325"/><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>.
On regaining the coveted office, however, he returned to Ireland, and instead of
following out the King’s instructions, proceeded to stir up his adherents into
open rebellion, and neglected the English at Dublin. Unmindful of his ‘hole duetie
to the Kingis Highnes,’ he used the royal authority deputed to him, ‘as a cloke or
habyte to cover his cruele persecutions, mynding utterly to extynguyshe the fame
and honor of any other noble man within that lande<a id="FNanchor_326_326"/><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>.’
It is possible that he thus served Henry’s and Cromwell’s ultimate purpose of
subjugation better than he knew, as he certainly weakened the power of many of the
wildest clans, who hated the English rule as much as his. But his use to the Crown
in this direction, if it amounted to anything, was only temporary, and things
became ripe for his dismissal. Continual complaints of him reached the King and
Cromwell. Dublin was almost the only place in the country, which remained perfectly
loyal to England. The neighbouring tribes were so hostile, that the citizens were
hard put to it for food, and its inhabitants almost perished from starvation. John
Deythyke, a priest, wrote sarcastically to a friend in the autumn of 1533, that
although it was the custom to refrain from meat on Wednesdays as well as Fridays,
provisions were so scarce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that people had become more devout still, and abstained also on Sundays, Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Thursdays. ‘This is a very sore abstenaunce <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> the country is so
quiett that they dare nott ryde one myle owte of the towne, to by any maner of
vytteyles; and they make there complaynt to the Deputie and the wynde hath blowen
hym soo in the erys that he can nott here them. But yt is a comon sayinge “whoo is
so defe as he that lyst not to here<a id="FNanchor_327_327"/><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>.”’
Things went on from bad to worse, and finally John Alen, Master of the Rolls in
Ireland, was sent over by the Council there to report Kildare’s doings at the
English Court, and further to submit to the King a set of articles for the reformation
of the abuses which had become prevalent in the country<a id="FNanchor_328_328"/><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>.
Alen finally succeeded in procuring Kildare’s recall; and the Deputy arrived in
London in April, 1534, having left his eldest son, Lord Thomas Fitzgerald, in his
place. Efforts were made to induce the young man to come to England also; and when
he persistently refused to put himself into the King’s hands, his father was arrested
and sent to the Tower. These vigorous measures, according to Chapuys, were due to
Cromwell; they were the beginnings of his policy of subjugation<a id="FNanchor_329_329"/><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>.</p>

<p>The arrest of Kildare, coupled with a premature report of his death, set half
Ireland aflame, and his son, making up a slight quarrel he had had with his kinsmen
the Desmonds threw off his allegiance. All the English were ordered out of the
Geraldines’ land before a certain day. The Archbishop of Dublin attempted to flee
the country, but encountering a storm, was driven back on the Irish coast, fell
into young Thomas’ hands, and was murdered with most of his following<a id="FNanchor_330_330"/><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>.
A formidable revolt against the royal authority was evidently pending. Henry and
Cromwell were seriously alarmed, and the extraordinary popularity of the rebellion
among the people in England, who, as Chapuys said, thought it ‘a very good beginning
to remedy matters at home,’ greatly increased their fears<a id="FNanchor_331_331"/><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>.
Cromwell had to bear the brunt of all the blame,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and the Duke of Norfolk seized the opportunity to speak ill of his successful
rival. According to Chapuys, the Duke had ‘left the Court to be away when the
affairs of Ireland were discussed, and this out of disdain that the King despised
his advice, and at the suggestion of Cromwell and Skeffington had ill-treated the
earl of Kildare, and ruined the affairs of Ireland. On this subject the Duke and
Cromwell had reproached each other with many things <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> which shows the ill-will
they have borne each other a long time, however much they have dissembled
it<a id="FNanchor_332_332"/><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>.’
But Norfolk’s efforts to undermine the influence of his rival were as yet
unavailing. The time for pacific measures had now passed; Henry would have been
only too glad to grant Kildare peace on any terms, but the latter refused every
offer. Skeffington, who was Cromwell’s friend, was sent over again as Deputy to
quell the rebellion. After many delays he crossed on the 14th of October, with
troops which the King had secretly raised for him<a id="FNanchor_333_333"/><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>.</p>

<p>Meantime the rebels had gained a decisive victory, and were just outside the
walls of Dublin. Piteous entreaties from the inhabitants, begging him to come to
the relief of the beleaguered city, reached Skeffington, and after some delay he
advanced. His arrival made the rebels retreat, but instead of pursuing them vigorously,
and striking a telling blow, he remained at Dublin, and wasted time in trying to
get a sentence of excommunication passed against the murderers of Archbishop
Alen<a id="FNanchor_334_334"/><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>.
But in spite of the Deputy’s dallying inefficiency, the superiority of Cromwell’s
policy to Norfolk’s was destined to be made evident by succeeding events. A new
complication in Irish affairs arose when young Kildare, taking advantage of Skeffington’s
inactivity, sent an embassy to the Emperor, promising to hold Ireland as a fief of
the Holy See, on condition that he would offer him protection against the English
schismatics<a id="FNanchor_335_335"/><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a>.
An ambassador, Dominick Power by name, was sent by Charles to Ireland and Scotland,
but Henry soon discovered it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
complained<a id="FNanchor_336_336"/><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>;
Charles was not quite ready as yet to do anything active in aid of the rebels,
and so the affair came to nothing. Meantime, at the request of Cromwell, Skeffington
was induced to shake off his apathy, leave Dublin and Drogheda, and move after the
rebels<a id="FNanchor_337_337"/><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>.
The Lord Privy Seal’s boast that the young Kildare would soon be a prisoner in the
Tower, was not as empty as Chapuys thought. Maynooth Castle, a rebel stronghold,
was besieged and taken<a id="FNanchor_338_338"/><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>;
many rebels were executed, others fell away from Kildare, the young Earl finally
surrendered, and was sent a prisoner to London. Two years later he was hanged with
five uncles at Tyburn<a id="FNanchor_339_339"/><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>.
With his surrender other chieftains came to terms; many districts became comparatively
quiet, and by the end of 1535 Ireland seemed further on the road to tranquillity
than she had been for some time. This was a significant triumph for Cromwell’s
policy over that of Norfolk, and did much to increase his influence with the King.
On the last day of December, 1535, Skeffington died, and Lord Leonard Grey was
made Deputy in his place<a id="FNanchor_340_340"/><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>.</p>

<p>Before Cromwell could hope to derive much benefit from Ireland, it was necessary
to establish some sort of government in the country, as well as to subjugate it.
To this intent, Lord Grey summoned a Parliament, which met at Dublin in the spring
of 1536<a id="FNanchor_341_341"/><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>.
Its first act was to pass a bill securing the succession of Anne Boleyn’s issue:
the report of this came to Cromwell in London in June, two weeks after Anne’s
execution<a id="FNanchor_342_342"/><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>.
He must have been somewhat puzzled, when he heard the news; events were moving so
rapidly, that even an ‘ordered’ Parliament could not keep pace with them. He finally
wrote back that in case the act for the succession was not ‘passed thoroughly’
they were to ‘staye the same tyl further knowleage of his grac<i>es</i>
pleasure<a id="FNanchor_343_343"/><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>.’
It was too late, however, to do this; but when the report came that Anne had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
been executed, and that Jane Seymour had become Queen, the Parliament was ready
enough at once to rescind the old statute, and pass a new one in favour of the
issue of Henry’s third wife. Later there were enacted a series of measures to
loosen the bonds that held the Irish Church to Rome<a id="FNanchor_344_344"/><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>,
and George Browne, Provincial of the Austin Friars, who had already made himself
useful in forcing the oath of succession on his brethren in the south of England,
was nominated in 1535, by Cromwell’s influence, to succeed Alen as Archbishop of
Dublin. The Deputy meantime carried on the subjugation steadily and consistently
in the wilder portions of the country.</p>

<p>Everything in Ireland was now proceeding to the complete satisfaction of Henry
and Cromwell, except the finances. Few could equal Cromwell’s ideal, or satisfy
Henry’s avarice in this respect. Ireland had never paid its expenses before; and
it was largely in the hope of deriving revenue from a land which had hitherto been
only a burden, that the King and his minister had undertaken to subjugate it. A
letter from Henry to the Deputy and Council in 1537 blames them for taking
excessive fees, thinking only of private gain, and not taking care of the royal
income<a id="FNanchor_345_345"/><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>.
To remedy this Cromwell appointed and sent over Commissioners, who were ordered
to try to reduce expenses and increase revenue, and, to this end, to inquire into
the conduct of every royal officer in Ireland, learn all the particulars of the
local government, and cut down the retinue of the Deputy and Treasurer to 340
men<a id="FNanchor_346_346"/><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>.
In the list of Commissioners occurs the name of William Brabazon (Cromwell’s old
friend and fellow servant under Wolsey), who later attained a very important
position in Irish affairs. The extant letters of Cromwell to the Commissioners
deal for the most part with the adjustment of petty land claims. The most interesting
of them is the one concerning the policy to be pursued towards ‘that traytor Bryan
Oconor<a id="FNanchor_347_347"/><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>.’</p>

<p>There are significant depositions against some of these Commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
who dared to murmur at Cromwell’s notorious accessibility to bribes, which seems
to have been more noticeable in his dealings with Ireland than anywhere else. He
appears to have received enormous sums from the rich and powerful family of the
Butlers, kinsmen of Anne Boleyn and of the Duke of Norfolk, in return for a promise
to protect their castles from the search of the royal agents. There was a great
deal of discontent among the Commissioners on account of his rapacity, and though
they openly flattered him, they continually spoke ill of him behind his back. ‘My
Lorde Pryvee Seale hathe wrought to his awne confusion and dethe,’ said one, ‘and
of late tyme was veray nere the same, and escapid veray narrowly <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> noo lorde
or gentilman in Englande berith love or favor to my Lorde Pryvee Seale by cause he
is soo great a taker of money, for he woll speke, solicite, or doo for noo man, but
all for <span class="nowrap">money. . . .</span> I wold not be in his case for all that ever he hathe, for
the King beknaveth him twice a weke, and sometyme knocke him well aboute the pate;
and yet when he hathe bene well pomeld about the hedde, and shaken up, as it were
a dogge, he will come out into the great chambre, shaking of the bushe with as
mery a countenaunce as thoughe he mought rule all the roste<a id="FNanchor_348_348"/><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>.’
We may well believe that Henry was willing that Cromwell should make some private
gains, provided he brought money to the royal treasury as well.</p>

<p>The subjugation of the country, however, had not yet been thoroughly accomplished.
Though 1537 was comparatively quiet, the following year witnessed a fresh outbreak.
Taking advantage of the precarious condition of England’s foreign affairs at the
time, young Gerald, brother of the late Earl of Kildare, and heir to his power,
stirred up various chieftains, and baffled all the attempts of the Deputy to lure
him into the King’s hands. Letters for aid were written to the Pope and to Cardinal
Pole, and were sent by a certain monk, as the safest means of transmitting them to
their destination<a id="FNanchor_349_349"/><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a>.
The monk sailed from Scotland in a French ship, which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
blown ashore on the English coast at South Shields; the messenger was captured,
and the letter intercepted<a id="FNanchor_350_350"/><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>.
In September, 1539, there were several skirmishes between the various forces of
the rebels and the Deputy; but the latter was generally victorious, and another
crisis was tided over<a id="FNanchor_351_351"/><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>.
Young Gerald was forced to flee into Brittany, and the rebels were left without a
leader. The Deputy, Lord Grey, appears to have become very unpopular during his
term of service, however, and in the spring of 1540 he was recalled<a id="FNanchor_352_352"/><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a>,
on the accusations of violence to the King’s Council, extortion, injustice, and
maintaining the King’s enemies. Affairs were in a bad state after he left; Scotch
intrigues, even an invasion of the country by James, were rumoured<a id="FNanchor_353_353"/><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>,
and Sir William Brereton, who temporarily filled Grey’s place, had a very hard
time. Grey was finally condemned and executed a year after Cromwell’s fall, and
Sir Anthony St. Leger, ‘the discreet,’ who had been the Chief of Commissioners of
1537, was sent over as Deputy in 1541<a id="FNanchor_354_354"/><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>.</p>

<p>It may be said that from 1534 until his fall, Cromwell was the virtual ruler of
Ireland. His significant triumph over Norfolk and his policy of pacification, mark
the beginning of his influence. From that time onward the King left to him the
entire direction of Irish affairs; he appointed the officers, regulated the
revenues, and in short managed everything connected with the country until 1540.
From the instructions which the Commissioners received in 1537, we gather that the
main object of the Crown was to get a revenue from Ireland, and the plan which
Cromwell pursued in order to attain this end is noteworthy, in that it differed so
entirely from his policy in all the rest of England’s dependencies. Realizing that
the country was worse than useless to the King, while it remained in the state in
which it was when he came into power, he saw that it was so wild and disorganized,
that subjugation by force would be possible and profitable, if attempted vigorously,
and in time. He therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
pursued a most aggressive policy, which in Scotland, for instance, where the
conditions were so different, he would never have dared to adopt.</p>

<p>In Wales he was confronted with a problem of a very different nature. What was
needed there was thorough legal reform. The country was not large enough to render
an insurrection there very formidable, but the wild and lawless state of the Welsh
Marches, which afforded hiding-places for criminals of all kinds, was a source of
much evil. One Thomas Philips wrote to Cromwell in May, 1532<a id="FNanchor_355_355"/><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a>,
that the whole country was in great decay, and that the King’s representatives
there took fines for felony and murder, and used the money for their own purposes;
he begged that such a council might soon be established in Wales, that the best
officer should ‘quake,’ if found in fault. The Bishop of Exeter, who was President
of the Marches, was an inefficient ruler and took no pains to remedy the existing
evils. The crimes of making and uttering counterfeit money seem to have been
extremely common<a id="FNanchor_356_356"/><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a>.
Cromwell saw that it was high time measures were taken to rectify this lawlessness,
and his ‘remembrances’ are full of items for the reform of Wales. He replaced the
Bishop of Exeter by his own friend Rowland Lee, Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield,
who in his younger days had served with him under Wolsey<a id="FNanchor_357_357"/><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>.
Lee’s energetic and business-like methods rendered him a fit man for the place,
and he set about reorganizing and reforming Wales in earnest. It was probably at
his instance that Cromwell devised several Acts, passed in the Parliament of 1534,
to establish justice and maintain order<a id="FNanchor_358_358"/><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>.
As the King’s writ did not run in Wales, it was next to impossible to get a case
fairly heard there; so Royal Commissioners were sent thither, with authority to
punish crimes and felonies (which were to be tried in the next English court), and
to establish Justices of the Peace. Chapuys, in a letter written in December, 1535,
describes the distress of the Welsh at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
these measures as incredible, saying that Parliament ‘has just taken away their
native laws, customs, and privileges, which is the very thing they can endure
least patiently<a id="FNanchor_359_359"/><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>.’
He further states that the Welsh were violently in favour of the cause of
Katherine and Mary, and longed for an opportunity to declare themselves. A rising
was probably prevented by the fact that the King himself was of Welsh descent.
Cromwell was exceedingly active in his endeavours to stamp out all sedition of
this sort, and was ably seconded by Lee, who, when the clergy in 1535 were required
to preach in favour of the Royal Supremacy, and against the power of the Pope,
declared himself ready to ride into his diocese in his own person and carry out
the decree, though, as he confessed, he had never before been in a pulpit<a id="FNanchor_360_360"/><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>.
But Lee adopted other measures to extirpate sedition, far more vigorous than
preaching in favour of the Royal Supremacy; he never failed to enforce his words
by deeds. He hung and beheaded offenders and criminals right and left, and sent
full reports of his doings to Cromwell, who must have rejoiced to find an agent
whose energy corresponded so closely to his own<a id="FNanchor_361_361"/><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>.</p>

<p>But in spite of Lee’s goodwill, the state of Wales was not satisfactory, until
Cromwell’s great statute of 1535 was passed<a id="FNanchor_362_362"/><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>.
By this Act, Wales was formally declared to be incorporated with England, to be
entitled to the same privileges, and to be subject to the same laws. The Marches
were declared to be in disorder, and were annexed or divided into shires. The King
was further empowered by the Act to erect courts in Wales every five years. These
fundamental reforms laid the basis for an entirely new method of administration of
justice there, and the country henceforth ceased to cause anxiety to its prince.</p>

<p>In striking contrast to Cromwell’s vigorous policy in Ireland and Wales, was
his conciliatory attitude towards Scotland. The strength and proximity of this
country, and the weak defences of the northern marches of England, were a constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
source of alarm, which was rather increased than diminished by Henry’s strained
relations with those continental powers who were on the best of terms with James.
It was obvious that in case of a foreign invasion of England from the Continent,
the enmity of Scotland would be the only thing lacking, to render disaster certain.
It is also not improbable that an attack from the north would have been welcomed
by some of Henry’s more disaffected subjects. In his speech in the Parliament of
1523 Cromwell had advocated a policy of unification with Scotland: from this
principle he never departed, but he saw that it was now no time to gain his ends
by force. He therefore adopted a pacificatory attitude towards Scotland at the
opening of his ministry, and consistently followed it until the end. He began by
persuading his master to make every effort to strengthen the rather precarious truce
which, owing to French mediation, had been concluded between the Commissioners of
the two countries upon the Borders, Oct. 1, 1533<a id="FNanchor_363_363"/><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>.
Anxious to show all possible courtesy to the Scottish delegates who were finally
sent to London to open negotiations, the King prepared for them a house, which had
been occupied by the Grand Master of France, and, contrary to his custom with most
ambassadors, supplied it with choice wines and provisions<a id="FNanchor_364_364"/><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>.
The Scots were not slow to realize the strength of their position, and in proportion
as Henry’s desire to conclude a permanent peace increased, their movements grew
more and more deliberate. After long delays, which exasperated the King greatly,
an alliance was finally made, to continue during the joint lives of the two sovereigns,
and one year longer. During the two following years Henry continued his pacific
policy by making James a Knight of the Garter, and by sending an embassy to induce
him to abandon the Pope. The latter plan was doubtless a suggestion of Cromwell’s;
a mention of the ambassadors Barlow and Howard occurs in his ‘remembrances,’ and
Barlow later wrote him continual reports of his progress. The mission was unsuccessful
in attaining its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> purpose;
but there were no signs that James’ leaning to Rome would render him an active
enemy of England<a id="FNanchor_365_365"/><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>.</p>

<p>The year 1537 brought with it new developments of Scottish policy. James had gone
abroad to marry Madeleine of Valois, an alliance highly displeasing to Henry, after
all his efforts to counteract his nephew’s tendency to lean upon the goodwill of Francis.
The King proceeded to express his vexation in an emphatic manner, and, contrary to
the advice of his Council, refused to permit James to return to Scotland from France
through England<a id="FNanchor_366_366"/><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>.
James’ marriage and Henry’s outspoken wrath stultified all Cromwell’s efforts to bring
about a cordial personal feeling and a lasting peace between the two sovereigns.
The Scots’ King was forced to travel by sea; but events took place on the voyage which
filled Henry with suspicion. Twelve Englishmen boarded the Scottish ship when it touched
at Scarborough for provisions, welcomed James, and promised their aid if he invaded
England. This episode was repeated at another town further north, and it was even reported
that the Scottish King had boasted, that if he lived a year longer, ‘he would himself
break a spear on one Englishman’s breast<a id="FNanchor_367_367"/><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a>.’
Such incidents must have been unpleasant, coming as they did just after a serious northern
revolt had with difficulty been quelled, and while the Borders were still in a wild
and lawless state. But any thoughts James may have entertained of an invasion were interrupted
by the sudden death of his young French Queen. Henry perhaps had hoped that his nephew
would come to him with offers of peace and a petition for the hand of the Princess
Mary, but, if so, he was rudely disappointed. In October it was announced that James
was engaged to marry a second French wife, Mary of Guise<a id="FNanchor_368_368"/><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a>;
and though Henry, at that time a widower, made every effort to prevent the match by
putting himself forward as a rival to his nephew, his proposals were courteously
set aside<a id="FNanchor_369_369"/><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
That the King of France should have distinctly preferred a Scottish to an English
alliance when the choice lay open, stung Henry to the quick; but he was quite
aware that he could not afford just then to quarrel with Francis or James, and he
may have regretted that he had not taken his minister’s advice to conciliate the
latter. The history of Henry’s relations with his nephew from this time until
Cromwell’s fall, yields ample proof of the complete triumph of the English minister’s
pacificatory policy. Attempts made in the past to stir up Border jealousies were
completely abandoned, and England seemed almost suspiciously desirous to show
every courtesy to her troublesome northern neighbour. A letter of Cromwell to Sir
Thomas Wharton<a id="FNanchor_370_370"/><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>,
deputy Warden of the West Marches, directs him to hand over to the Scottish
officers an arrant traitor who had made his escape to England, even if the Scots
failed to ‘doo the semblable.’ Actions as gracious as this were a new thing on the
Borders: the usual policy in the past had been for each nation to give shelter to
the outlaws who had fled to it from the other. The news that David Beton, Abbot of
Arbroath, had been raised by the Pope to the cardinalate and was working at the
Scottish Court in the interests of Rome, made Henry still more anxious to preserve
friendship with his nephew, and to preclude all chances of his being induced to
join a continental league against England<a id="FNanchor_371_371"/><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>.
So in January, 1540, we find him sending Ralph Sadler, Cromwell’s old friend, to
James, to counteract, if possible, the effect of the visit of Beton<a id="FNanchor_372_372"/><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>.
By the capture of certain letters in a Scottish ship which had been wrecked on the
Northumbrian coast, Henry had been furnished with the means of misrepresenting the
objects of the Cardinal at his nephew’s Court. Sadler was instructed to hint that
Beton was plotting to usurp all the authority of the King of Scotland, and to advise
James to be on his guard. The ambassador was further directed to conciliate the
Scottish King by a present of six geldings, to assure him of Henry’s friendship,
and to suggest that James augment his revenue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
by suppressing the monasteries in his kingdom as his uncle had done in England.
Finally Sadler was to represent to the Scots’ King the advantages of an alliance
with England over one with France, and to request him to ponder on the desirability
of eradicating the ancient enmity of the two peoples, especially in view of the
fact that he might some day himself succeed to his uncle’s crown. The result of
the mission taken as a whole was satisfactory. Though James refused to accede to
any of Henry’s more definite requests, and would not listen to any proposals to
abolish the old religion or to suppress the monasteries, he still assured Sadler
that no alliance he made on the Continent would lead him to break with England,
and further enlarged on the benefits that would result from a meeting with his
uncle, though he puzzled the envoy by suggesting that Francis should also be
present<a id="FNanchor_373_373"/><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>.
The mission of Sadler marks the last stage of the relations of England and
Scotland during Cromwell’s ministry; and the fact that war between the two
countries broke out so soon after his fall, furnishes a final reason for believing
that it was by the able and unceasing efforts of the Privy Councillor that an open
rupture was so long averted.</p>

<p>Lastly, a few words remain to be said on the subject of the government of
Calais. If the name of that town were graven on the heart of Mary Tudor at her
death, from the grief which its loss during her reign caused her, it must have
been also graven upon the minds of her father and his minister, from the trouble
its maintenance gave them during the last seven years of the latter’s power. In
March, 1533, Arthur Plantagenet, Viscount Lisle, was nominated successor to that
learned soldier, Lord Berners, as Deputy there, and took the oaths at the town, on
the 10th of June<a id="FNanchor_374_374"/><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>.
The choice was certainly unfortunate, and Lisle’s unfitness for his new position
was destined soon to be made evident. He seems to have been a man completely
lacking in the qualities necessary for a good ruler of such a place as Calais was
in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> days: he possessed
small discrimination in judging what things he could deal with by his own authority,
and what things it was necessary to report to head quarters. Hence there are many
mild rebukes among Cromwell’s letters to him<a id="FNanchor_375_375"/><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>,
in some of which he chides him for bothering the King about such a trivial thing
as a private quarrel between two minor officials in Calais, while in others he
‘mervayles not a litel’ that he should be so negligent as not to make immediate
report of sacrilegious preaching. Calais was by no means an easy post to manage;
Henry and Cromwell kept its officers and garrison exceedingly short of money; the
soldiers wrangled and mutinied, and religious conferences amongst the townspeople
sometimes took most violent forms, and not seldom resulted in dangerous riots.
Placed as a sort of spy on the movements of Francis and the Emperor, in a town,
the government of which on a small scale presented all the difficulties of that of
a great kingdom, the Deputy was in a position which demanded resources greater
than his own.</p>

<p>The first part of Lisle’s administration seems to have been comparatively
uneventful. Cromwell, always keenly alive to the necessity of having the country
in an adequate state of defence, at once caused him to repair all breaches in the
ramparts, a task which Lisle set about without competent men or supplies; and the
immediate result of his ill-judged attempts to lay a new foundation for one of his
walls was the fall of the small part of the old fortification which was yet
standing<a id="FNanchor_376_376"/><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>.
Lisle was of course continually busied in preventing his neighbours, French and
Flemish, from meddling with the King’s Pale, especially throughout the year 1536,
when the war between Francis and the Emperor broke out afresh<a id="FNanchor_377_377"/><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>.
He tried to keep the town well victualled and in good defence, and was zealous to
do as he was bidden by Cromwell, though seldom successful, for he lacked ability.
After 1537 he was confronted with a new and more difficult problem.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1538, Cranmer heard that there were seven or eight persons in
Calais, who manifestly denied Christ.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
His Commissary there, John Butler, asserted that this report was false, but in a
later epistle advised the Archbishop that there were three papists in the town,
who slandered those who applied themselves to God’s word; the letter went on to
suggest that Cromwell be requested to write to Lisle to have them punished<a id="FNanchor_378_378"/><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>.
The minister, however, had heard of the existence of ‘certayn Sacramentaryes’ or
deniers of transubstantiation there, before this report arrived, and had written
the Deputy a severe reproof for not informing him about them<a id="FNanchor_379_379"/><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a>.
The state of foreign affairs at that moment was such as to render it indispensable
for the King to preserve the appearance of being zealous for orthodoxy, and he had
called on his efficient minister to aid him in his attempts to extirpate heretical
doctrines. The rebuke which the latter had administered to the Deputy seems in
this case to have been undeserved, for Lisle, who apparently was more on the watch
than usual this time, had certainly sent home information about the Sacramentaries
before he received Cromwell’s epistle: the two letters perhaps crossed on the way.
That of the Deputy reported the arrival in Calais of a young English priest,
lately come from Germany, who had uttered opinions about the Eucharist which the
King would not tolerate, and which had shocked the good people of Calais beyond
measure. This young priest can have been none other than Adam Damplip, originally
a strong papist, who (according to Foxe) had been chaplain to Fisher, and at the
Cardinal’s execution had left England and travelled in France, Germany, and Italy.
His sojourn in foreign lands must have altered his opinions completely, for when
he came to Calais his doctrines were so ‘advanced’ and heretical, that as a result
of a warning of Cromwell’s, in his letter to Lisle of May 14<a id="FNanchor_380_380"/><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>,
a decree was made out by the Council of the town that Butler, the Commissary who
had given Damplip licence to preach, would be held responsible for any false
opinions that the priest expressed<a id="FNanchor_381_381"/><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>.</p>

<p>Determined as he was to extirpate unlawful and treasonable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
doctrines both at home and abroad, Cromwell was too much absorbed in the
maintenance of his foreign policy, and the prevention of the pressing dangers
which threatened the country from without, to pay much attention to Damplip at
Calais during the latter part of 1538 and 1539. He was far more anxious to have
the town well victualled and defended, in case of a sudden attack from France or
Spain. Damplip himself, however, had gone over to England to answer to the charges
brought against him before Cranmer<a id="FNanchor_382_382"/><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a>.
The result of the examination seems to have been very favourable to him, and the
Archbishop, in a letter to Cromwell about it, supported the position which the
priest had taken up in only denying Transubstantiation while admitting the Real
Presence<a id="FNanchor_383_383"/><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>.
But the accusations from Calais against the Sacramentaries did not cease. Lisle
and the Council, now thoroughly roused, kept sending in depositions against Damplip,
until Cromwell, in May, 1539, rebuked them for uncharitable behaviour, saying that
the affair was being made too much of, and that the King was busy about other
things<a id="FNanchor_384_384"/><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>.
Exhortations to ‘charyte and myld handeling’ were not Cromwell’s usual style; and
in this case at least they were superseded within ten days by instructions of a
very different nature. The cause of the sudden change is doubtless to be found in
the debate on the Six Articles, just then at its height. Cromwell saw the trend
things were taking, and understood that as the doctrine of Transubstantiation was
evidently about to be confirmed at home, it would be extremely dangerous for him
to urge leniency towards those who opposed it at Calais. He consequently sent
another letter to Lisle<a id="FNanchor_385_385"/><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a>,
in which he retreated from his former position, and ordered the Commissary and
the parish priest of Our Lady Church to be sent in custody to England. The subsequent
appearance of these men before the Privy Council seems to have resulted in their
acquittal, and a public recantation in the Market Place at Calais was deemed
sufficient to prevent a recurrence to the heresy. The recall of Lord Lisle in
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> spring of 1540 was
probably less due to his inefficiency in handling the affair of the Sacramentaries,
than to the many proofs he had given of general incompetence. He was committed to
the Tower, where he remained a close prisoner till January, 1542, when a message
was sent to him that he was pardoned and restored to favour. The story is that his
joy at hearing this news was so great, that he died of excitement that same
night<a id="FNanchor_386_386"/><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>.</p>

<p>That Calais was not lost to England under the incompetent management of Lisle
(whose actions from first to last were too much influenced by the whims of a
foolish wife), was solely due to the guidance which he received from Cromwell. The
brilliant success of the great minister’s administration in England was fully
equalled by the wisdom and skill of his dealings with her immediate neighbours and
dependencies. In every case the dominant principle of his policy had been the
same; the completion of the work begun by Henry VII.—the elevation of the Crown to
absolute power on the ruins of every other institution which had ever been its
rival. In attaining this end, which (as we must not forget) was one that commended
itself to most patriotic Englishmen of the time, Cromwell had been confronted by a
multitude of problems of great difficulty and infinite diversity: he handled them
all with uniform success; and the monarchy, under his guidance, passed safe
through one of the gravest crises in the history of the realm, finally to emerge
triumphant, absolute, supreme in Church and State.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE MONASTERIES</p>

<p>The suppression of the English monasteries, though in one sense but a single
branch of Cromwell’s internal administration, still deserves to be considered in a
separate chapter. Of all the changes that followed the breach with Rome, none
bears as plainly as this the stamp of Cromwellian origin. The sinister genius of
the King’s minister particularly fitted him for this task of destruction, and his
title of <i>malleus-monachorum</i> is thoroughly well deserved. Cromwell’s intent
in suppressing the monasteries was obviously, like that of all the rest of his
internal administration, the strengthening of the Crown: how far his measures were
successful in accomplishing what was expected of them must be determined not only
from their immediate effects, but also from the developments which later resulted
from them.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out in an earlier chapter that the state of the lesser
monasteries was far from satisfactory in Cromwell’s time; but that in spite of
this, when Wolsey’s agents suppressed a few of them in order to convert their
revenues to the use of the Cardinal’s cherished colleges, a loud cry of indignation
was immediately raised among the rural population. During his first few years in
Wolsey’s service Cromwell had acquired sufficient experience to master at least
the elementary principles of monastic confiscation, but before he had gone half as
far as he had probably intended, his master’s attainder and his own consequent
change of life had temporarily interrupted the work. We have seen that as soon as
the King had arbitrarily assumed the Headship of the Church of England, Cromwell
immediately cast about for means to secure him in his new position. To this end he
had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> weakened the bishops
and also the lesser clergy; the dissolution of the monasteries immediately presented
itself to him as a consistent method of following up these measures. It all tended
in the same direction of severing England’s connexion with Rome and of establishing
the Royal Supremacy. The scheme of suppressing the monasteries also promised great
things from a financial point of view; Cromwell could have hit upon no better plan
than this to aid him to fulfil his promise to make Henry ‘the richest King that
ever was in Christendom.’ If the idea of dissolving the religious houses in order
to increase the wealth of the Crown, had occurred to Henry during Wolsey’s administration,
he would hardly have dared to carry it out while there was any chance of avoiding
a breach with the Pope; but now the course of events had converted the only objection
to the plan into an argument in its favour. There was certainly nothing in the
conscience of the King or of his minister to deter them from such a step, when so
much advantage both political and financial promised to result from it.</p>

<p>In January, 1535, two documents appeared—the first, a royal commission to
Thomas Cromwell authorizing him as the King’s Vicar-general to undertake a general
visitation of churches, monasteries, and clergy, and to depute others to act as
his agents; the second consisting of a series of formal inquiries to be made concerning
the state of the religious houses, and royal injunctions for their reform. The
latter is written in a strange hand, copiously interlined and corrected by that of
the King’s minister<a id="FNanchor_387_387"/><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>.
The decrees were quickly put in operation. By the month of August in the same year
Cromwell’s two agents, Legh and Ap-Rice, were hard at work among the Wiltshire
monasteries, and sent in their reports to their master full of ludicrously pathetic
lamentations, when unable to trump up any plausible charges against the monks<a id="FNanchor_388_388"/><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a>.
Doctor Richard Layton, who had come under Cromwell’s notice at the time of the
trials of More and Fisher, sent him a request for employment on the same mission,
and eventually got permission to go to Gloucestershire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><a id="FNanchor_389_389"/><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a>.
He had made a preliminary visitation at Bath and Farley, and while there had
aroused the jealousy and hatred of Legh, who wrote to Cromwell complaining that he
was not sufficiently severe, and urging the necessity of uniformity of action<a id="FNanchor_390_390"/><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>.
A great many grumbling letters of this kind were sent to Cromwell by his visitors.
Layton and Ap-Rice were not slow to revenge themselves on Legh by reporting to the
Vicar-general the pride, arrogance, ‘sumptuus vsage, and roughe fasshyon’ of their
hated colleague<a id="FNanchor_391_391"/><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>.</p>

<p>The bad character of Cromwell’s agents, and the devices to which they were
forced to have recourse in order to extort from the monks the information they
desired, furnish ample proof of the unfairness of many of the reports which they
made. The ‘Commissioners found means,’ as it has been significantly stated, ‘to
make divers monasteries obnoxious<a id="FNanchor_392_392"/><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>.’
Cromwell had taken special pains that the efforts of his agents should not be
hindered by any external interference: it was to this end that he had issued the
Prohibitory Letter to the bishops in the month of September<a id="FNanchor_393_393"/><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>.
Legh, Layton, and Ap-Rice were left a perfectly clear field, and devoted
themselves to examining into the monastic discipline, and to inducing discontented
monks to accuse their fellows. The arrogant Legh was especially efficient in this
particular, as is shown by the letters Cromwell received from the monasteries he
had visited. One monk wrote to the Vicar-general that the inmates of his house
cared nothing for true religion, but came to mattins ‘as dronck as myss and [played]
sume at cardes, sume at dyyss<a id="FNanchor_394_394"/><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>’—and
finally imparted the significant piece of information that Cromwell’s visitors had
ordered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> him to write these
opinions to head quarters. Another, John Placett by name, sent cringing letters to
the Vicegerent, begging that his zeal in advancing the new doctrines and in
reporting those who opposed them, might be rewarded by official exemption from
rising at midnight and from observing the customary fasts<a id="FNanchor_395_395"/><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>.
Epistles of this sort form the bulk of Cromwell’s correspondence during the years
1535 and 1536. The chief reason why the Vicar-general did not protest against this
flood of defamatory information, which through the efficiency of the zealous Legh
continually poured in upon him, lay probably in the fact that along with these
reports there came also letters of a somewhat different nature which afforded him
excellent opportunities for private gain. ‘I submytt myselfe,’ wrote the Abbot of
Rewley, ‘fulle and holle to your mastershipp, as all my refuge, helpe, and socor
is yn yow, glad of my voluntarye mynde to be bounde in obligacion of one hunderd
powndes to be payed to your mastershipp, so that our house may be savyd<a id="FNanchor_396_396"/><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>.’
We may well believe that this proposal did not fall on deaf ears. Though we do not
possess the reply of Cromwell in this particular case, the letters which he sent
to the Priors of St. Faith’s and of Coxford in the same year, indicate that he was
as willing to accept bribes from the heads of monasteries as from any one
else<a id="FNanchor_397_397"/><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>.</p>

<p>Less crafty but scarcely less efficient than the untiring Legh was his brutal
colleague Layton. The Sussex monasteries which he visited in October, 1535, were
so unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span> as to incur
his particular displeasure. He does not appear to have troubled himself, like Legh,
with devising means to make the monks accuse one another: he reported everything
to head quarters on his own responsibility, and wrote to Cromwell how at one place
he found the abbot the ‘varaste hayne betle and buserde and the aranttes chorle’
he ever saw, while at another he swore that his master would scarcely believe
‘quanta sit spurcities.’ He concluded with two philosophic reflections that ‘sacerdotes
omnes non creati ex natura angelica, sed humana,’ and ‘that the blake sort of
dyvelisshe monkes <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> be paste amendment<a id="FNanchor_398_398"/><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a>.’
He possibly bore a personal grudge against these southern houses; at least this
seems a likely explanation of the fact that later investigation showed them to be
no worse than ordinary, and especially popular with their neighbours<a id="FNanchor_399_399"/><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a>.
Layton, however, found willing listeners to his accusations in the King and
Cromwell, and a commission was sent down to confiscate the property of the monasteries
of Dover, Langdon, and Folkestone, and to take the surrender of these houses into
the King’s hands. It was the first step of the great devastation which was to
ensue during the following four years.</p>

<p>The next scene of the visitors’ operations was in the northern counties. Early
in 1535 Layton had taken occasion to inform Cromwell that he and Legh were particularly
competent to carry on the work there. ‘Ther ys nother monasterie, selle, priorie,
nor any other religiouse howse in the north,’ he wrote, ‘but other doctor Lee or I
have familier acqwayntance within x or xii mylles of <span class="nowrap">hit. . . .</span>  We knowe and have
experiens bothe of the fassion off the contre and the rudenes of the pepull <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> ther
is matter sufficient to detecte and opyn all coloryde sanctitie, all supersticiouse
rewlles of pretensyde religion, and other abusys detestable of all sorttes<a id="FNanchor_400_400"/><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>.’
Cromwell certainly had no reason to be dissatisfied with the results which his
agents had already accomplished, and doubtless welcomed their zeal to continue
their labours in a new field. With most astounding rapidity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the visitation was carried through: all the houses in the north had been reported
on by the end of February. There was certainly an object in having the work
completed so quickly, for Parliament had already met, and was prepared to take
action on the ‘comperta’ or catalogue of offences sent in by Cromwell’s agents.
The extraordinary hurry in which the latter part of their task was accomplished,
and the suspicious uniformity of the offences reported, furnish a last and most
cogent reason for doubting the truth of the statements of the visitors. There must
of course have been some immorality in the monasteries: the abbots and heads of
houses were elected by the monks themselves, who were sure to have an eye to their
own ease, and would tend to choose those whose discipline was lax. But it must be
a prejudiced person indeed who will accept word for word the catalogues of the
religious persons reported guilty of the lowest and most degrading forms of vice,
which Legh and Layton seemed to delight in sending to their master. Parliament,
however, was too completely in Cromwell’s hands fairly to judge of the character
of the visitors, or of the circumstances under which they drew up their ‘comperta,’
and the report was strong and clear; so it was not long before the first Act for
the dissolution of the smaller monasteries was passed. The statute declared that
‘all Relygeous Houses of Monkes Chanons and Nonnes, whiche may not dyspend Manors,
Landes, Tenementes, &amp; Heredytamentes above the clere yerly Value of ij C li.
are geven to the Kinges Highnes, his heires and successours for ever<a id="FNanchor_401_401"/><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>.’
Another Act was passed at the same time establishing a Court of Augmentations of
the King’s revenue<a id="FNanchor_402_402"/><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a>.
Power was given to this court to collect the spoils, lands, and buildings of the
suppressed abbeys, and dispose of them in the way most profitable to the Crown. It
consisted of a chancellor, treasurer, solicitor, and thirty subordinates. The
chief persons in it were friends and hirelings of Cromwell’s. In April commissions
were sent to the principal men in every county<a id="FNanchor_403_403"/><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a>,
authorizing them to inquire further into the state of each house, to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
inventories and estimates of their property, and to ascertain the number of monks
who desired ‘capacities’ for entering secular life, and the number who intended to
remove to some other religious house. It is significant that the reports of these
men, concerning the character and morality of the inmates, are uniformly of a more
favourable description than those of Layton and Legh.</p>

<p>The process of the surrender immediately followed the first visit of the
Commissioners. They sent in their report to the Court of Augmentations, which then
issued its final orders for the dissolution of the house, and its conversion to
the King’s use. A ‘receiver’ was appointed to plunder the church, and sell the
lead, bells, &amp;c. An interesting letter, from an agent of Cromwell’s to his
master, sheds some light on the usual methods of these officials. ‘We ar pluckyng
down an hygher vaute,’ writes the receiver, ‘borne up by fower thicke and grose
pillars xiiij fote fro syde to syde, abowt in circumference xlv fote <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> we browght

Coupled with reports like this, came curiously confused accounts of the saleable
articles of the house, which had been disposed of, such as</p>

</table>

<p>It will be noticed that the sums for which these articles were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
sold, were very small. It is said that not more than £100,000 were obtained from
the sale of the jewels, plate, lead, bells, and other valuables, which were seized
in the first suppression of the monasteries. The annual incomes of the three
hundred and seventy-six houses which were suppressed, however, probably amounted
to about £32,000, a sum which was quite sufficient to render the measure a successful
one from a financial point of view.</p>

<p>In spite of the Act of Parliament, which declared that the monks were either to
be pensioned, or else moved to some other religious house, there is no doubt that
great misery and wretchedness invariably accompanied the dissolutions. Chapuys
writes: ‘It is a lamentable thing to see a legion of monks and nuns, who have been
chased from their monasteries, wandering miserably hither and thither, seeking
means to live, and several honest men have told me, that what with monks, nuns,
and persons dependent on the monasteries suppressed, there were over 20,000, who
knew not how to live<a id="FNanchor_406_406"/><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>.’
The Act for the protection of the exiled inmates cannot have been at all strictly
enforced, and there were certainly many monks, to whom no homes or means of living
were assigned. Sir Henry Ellis has printed a document, concerning the dissolution
of some of the monasteries, which was written in 1591 by one whose father and
uncle witnessed the scenes he describes. It tells how ‘it would have made an heart
of flint to have melted and wept to have seen the breaking up of the House, and
their sorrowful departing; and the sudden spoil that fell the same day of their
departure from the House. And every person had everything good cheap; except the
poor Monks, Friars, and Nuns, that had no money to bestow of any thing.’ The people
entered the church, ‘and took what they found, and filched it away<span class="nowrap">. . . .</span>  It would
have pitied any heart to see what tearing up of the lead there was, and plucking
up of boards, and throwing down of the sparres; <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and the tombs in the Church
(were) all broken, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and all things of price either spoiled, carped away, or
defaced to the uttermost<a id="FNanchor_407_407"/><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>.’
Nor is this tendency of the people of the neighbourhood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to plunder in the least to be wondered at. They knew that as the monasteries were
to be pulled down they would lose all the old charities, easy rents, and other
advantages to which they had so long been accustomed, and they naturally wished to
make good the loss. Cromwell probably did not object to this ruthless waste as
much as one would expect, for he saw that if he attempted to stop it, the feeling
against the suppression would be so strong, that it would be impossible to continue
it. As it was, the famous rebellion of the Pilgrimage of Grace, which broke out in
the northern counties, just as the first houses were being suppressed, gave him a
terrible warning of the general unpopularity of the change. The insurrection,
however, was soon quelled, and Cromwell’s genius was able to turn it to his own
advantage, and make it the pretext for carrying out the scheme which had probably
been part of his original plan, namely the suppression of all the monasteries; a
step which, without some valid excuse, he would have hardly dared to take.</p>

<p>In 1537 the visitors began to go to the larger monasteries, and intimidate
their inmates into surrender, mainly by threatening them with punishment for
complicity in the rebellion which had just been put down. An excellent example of
the way in which this was done, is given by the story of the suppression of the
two large Cistercian abbeys in Lancashire, Whalley and Furness<a id="FNanchor_408_408"/><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>.
John Pasleu, Abbot of Whalley, had been executed in March, 1537, by the Earl of
Sussex for his treason in taking part in the Pilgrimage of Grace. The Earl was
commended for this action by the King, who further desired him with ‘good dexteritie’
to ‘laye unto the charges of all the monkes there their grevous offences, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and
therwith assaye their myndes, whither they woll conforme themselfes gladly for the
redubbing of their former trespaces to goo to other houses of their cote <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> or
rather take capacities and soo receyve seculer habite<a id="FNanchor_409_409"/><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>.’
The Abbot of Furness was doubtless threatened with death if he refused to surrender
his house, for a month after the execution of his brother at Whalley, he signed a
document, by virtue of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
he handed over to the King his abbey, and all its lands and possessions, ‘knawyng
the mysorder and evyll liff both unto God and our prynce of the bredren of the said
monasterie<a id="FNanchor_410_410"/><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>.’</p>

<p>Another method of intimidation was to threaten punishment for superstition and
image worship. Against the latter Henry’s minister was particularly zealous. Some
of the images were very valuable, and could be sold for a high price. Two of the
most extraordinary of the venerated relics found in the ‘defacement’ of the monasteries
have become famous to posterity, under the names of the Rood of Grace, and the
Blood of Hailes. The former was a wonder-working crucifix, held in great veneration
at Boxley Abbey, which Geoffrey Chambers<a id="FNanchor_411_411"/><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>,
an agent of Cromwell’s, found full of ‘certen ingynes and olde wyer wyth olde
roton stykkes in the backe of the same, that dyd cause the eyes of the same to
move and stere in the hede thereof lyke unto a lyvelye thyng<a id="FNanchor_412_412"/><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a>.’
It was seized and exhibited, first in Kent, and then in London, and the ‘abusion
thereof dyvulged.’ The Blood of Hailes was a phial of liquid, which a tradition of
three centuries asserted to have been the blood of the Saviour<a id="FNanchor_413_413"/><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>.
The head of the monastery brought it to Cromwell in great perplexity, swearing
that he was willing to suffer the most shameful death, if the phial had been
meddled with in his day. A commission, appointed to inquire into it, took the
liquid out of the phial, and found it to be a thick, red, sticky substance. They
then gave it back to the abbot, to keep until he heard the King’s pleasure concerning
it. Meantime Bishop Hilsey had preached a sermon in denunciation of the fraud, in
which he asserted that a former abbot had told his paramour that the phial contained
only drake’s blood; but he was later compelled to take back this last statement,
as a result of the Commissioners’ inquiry. What ultimately became of the Blood of
Hailes has remained a mystery, but it is noteworthy that Cromwell was so annoyed,
at having unearthed a relic which proved valueless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
from a financial point of view, that when the ‘bluddy abbot,’ as Latimer called
him, came to consult him about it, he was forced to pay £140, his best mitre,
cross, and ‘another thyng or two,’ to make good the amount which Cromwell had
expected to obtain from the relic. The iconoclastic zeal of the Vicar-general
varied in proportion to the value of the image<a id="FNanchor_414_414"/><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>.</p>

<p>The first Act of dissolution had only given to the King the monasteries of
which the annual income was less than £200. But now that Cromwell, on the plea of
complicity in the late rebellion, had contrived to bring in all the larger
religious houses, so that a general suppression had in fact begun, a fresh Act was
needed to legalize his proceedings. So in the spring of 1539, a new statute was
passed for the dissolution of all monasteries and abbeys<a id="FNanchor_415_415"/><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>.
But long before this the main part of the work had been accomplished. When the
monks refused to be terrorized into submission, attainder and death invariably
followed. It is but justice to Cromwell’s agents to say, however, that their
methods of intimidation were so highly effectual that attainder was the exception,
and surrender the rule. The Commissioners may well have been surprised that any of
the abbots dared to stand out against them.</p>

<p>From 1537 to the end of 1539, the story of the suppression of the monasteries
is simply a catalogue of houses surrendered or confiscated, on more or less unjust
pretexts. So rapidly and thoroughly did Cromwell and his Commissioners accomplish
the work, that by the end of December no monastery in the country had been left
untouched, except Westminster Abbey, and a few other larger houses. The climax of
cruelty and injustice was reached in the executions of the Abbots of Glastonbury
and Reading. Cromwell’s famous remembrance concerning the latter was literally
obeyed. There was no pretence of a fair hearing of his case. He was sent down
‘<i>to be tryed and excecutyd</i>,’ as Cromwell had ordered it<a id="FNanchor_416_416"/><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a>.
The punishment of the Abbot of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Glastonbury was, if possible, even more unjust. Though weak and broken with age
and illness, he was arrested and sent up to the Tower, simply on the charge of
having in his monastery a book against the King’s divorce, divers pardons and
bulls, and a printed life of Becket<a id="FNanchor_417_417"/><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>.
It is stated that on examination Cromwell discovered that he had lent money to
the rebels in the Pilgrimage of Grace, but it mattered little whether this serious
charge was proved or not. His execution was determined on long beforehand, and his
rich and ancient abbey was plundered immediately after his arrest. His fate was
sealed long before his mock trial at Wells took place; the verdict of the
‘worshypfull jury’ was of course ‘guilty,’ and he was executed two days later on
Glastonbury Tor<a id="FNanchor_418_418"/><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a>.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the suppression of the monasteries came the fall of the
various houses of the friars. This had probably been a part of Cromwell’s scheme
from the very first; it will be remembered that several houses suffered in the
early part of his ministry, as a penalty for permitting their inmates to preach
against the King’s divorce. A sort of preliminary visitation had been carried on
in 1534, at Cromwell’s command, by his agents Browne and Hilsey<a id="FNanchor_419_419"/><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a>:
but a far more energetic person was found in Richard Ingworth, Bishop of Dover,
who, on the 6th of February, 1538, was commissioned by the Vicar-general to carry
on a second investigation, in which he was to visit all the houses of the various
orders of friars in England, to examine into and correct abuses, and to expel and
punish the guilty inmates<a id="FNanchor_420_420"/><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>.
As he refers to the King’s Vicegerent, as his ‘synguler helper for XII yeres
past<a id="FNanchor_421_421"/><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>,’
there is reason to think that he had been an intimate of Cromwell’s before the
latter had entered the royal service: it is possible that they had worked together
in the suppression of the monasteries which furnished funds for Wolsey’s colleges.
A greater traveller than Ingworth could scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
have been found in those days. The number of houses he visited during the first
six months of 1538 is perfectly amazing, but with all his energy, Richard of Dover
was far less efficient than his terrible master. When he hesitatingly wrote to
Cromwell to ask whether he should meddle with the White Friars of Winchester, he
received a smart rebuke for his doubts, and was told that though he had changed
his friar’s habit, he had not changed his friar’s heart<a id="FNanchor_422_422"/><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>.
The Vicar-general found it necessary to give him a coadjutor, and chose a singularly
apt man for his purpose in Dr. John London, Warden of New College, Oxford, who
received a special commission with the mayor and two others to ‘loke vpon’ the
friars of that town<a id="FNanchor_423_423"/><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a>.
The friars gave the Commissioners more trouble than the monks. They seemed to have
secret ways of learning when the visitors were going to arrive, and either
carefully hid, or else sold all their valuables beforehand, a fact which affords
the most probable explanation of the amount of poverty reported by the visitors.
Still the houses fell without ceasing; if not by voluntary surrender, by compulsion.
Nor did the visitors hesitate in the case of nunneries, to resort to the most
shameful devices to elicit a surrender. London’s conduct was so disgraceful, that
Cromwell was obliged to recognize the justice of the complaints of the Abbess of
Godstow against him, and ‘steye his procedinges<a id="FNanchor_424_424"/><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>.’
‘Doctor Londone,’ wrote the abbess to the Vicar-general, ‘whiche <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> was ageynste
my promotyon and hathe ever sence borne me greate malys and grudge like my mortall
enmye, is sodenlie cummyd unto me withe a greate rowte with him, and here dothe

tethe<a id="FNanchor_425_425"/><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>.’
It appears that London himself wrote to Cromwell the day after to beg him to
favour the abbess and her sisters<a id="FNanchor_426_426"/><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>.
Did he perhaps feel that he had gone too far, or are we to infer that his usual
methods were even more brutal than this?</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></p>

<p>And thus the work was finished. Within five years of the time that the first
visitation of the monasteries had begun, a complete devastation of all the
religious houses had been accomplished, and a torrent of wealth had been poured in
upon the Crown, ‘such,’ says Hallam, ‘as has seldom been equalled in any country,
by the confiscations following a subdued rebellion<a id="FNanchor_427_427"/><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>.’
The suppression which included the larger houses was evidently a far greater
financial success than the first. A new device for gaining revenue had been
invented, and put in operation during the last few years. It consisted in imposing
a fine on every place in which a religious house had existed, ‘for the toleracyon
and contynuaunce of the monastery ther<a id="FNanchor_428_428"/><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>’;
an ingenious device, which yielded a most substantial income. ‘The King had then
in his hand,’ says Burnet, ‘the greatest opportunity of making royal and noble
foundations that ever King of England had. But whether out of policy, to give a
general content to the gentry by selling to them at low rates, or out of easiness
to his courtiers, or out of an unmeasured lavishness of expense, it came far short
of what he had given out he would <span class="nowrap">do. . . .</span>  He designed to convert £18,000 into a
revenue for eighteen bishoprics and cathedrals. But of these he only erected <span class="nowrap">six. . . .</span> Great
sums were indeed laid out on building and fortifying many ports in the Channel,
and other parts of England<a id="FNanchor_429_429"/><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a>.’</p>

<p>Lacking any evidence from the sources on the subject of the use to which the
revenues from the suppression of the monasteries were put, one must judge from
this passage, and from subsequent events. An Act giving Henry the power to erect
bishoprics by letters patent, was passed in Parliament, May 23, 1539<a id="FNanchor_430_430"/><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>.
It was by the authority of this statute, that the King founded the six new bishops’
sees above mentioned, and also converted some of the old houses, such as Beverley,
Ripon, and Manchester, into collegiate churches. But the passage in Burnet also
hints at other methods of employing the money gained from the suppression of the
monasteries, which it seems likely that Cromwell suggested. The use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the funds to strengthen the coast defences along the Channel was always one of
his favourite schemes; it is probable that he found no difficulty in persuading
the King how necessary such a precaution was, in view of the danger of foreign
invasion, which threatened England at the close of 1539. But the plan of selling
the lands of the confiscated houses to the nobles at low prices, is even more
Cromwellian. It immediately reminds the reader of the course which Wolsey, ten
years before, had pursued at his servant’s advice, when he bought off the popular
hatred by grants out of his own lands and revenues. Cromwell plainly saw that
after the suppression, steps must be taken to ensure the permanence of the reform
he had effected. By judicious grants he turned aside the hatred of some of the
rural gentry, who were at first opposed to the destruction of the monasteries, and
thus, by rendering the work popular at home, he secured himself and it from the
attacks of Catholic potentates abroad. But his action at this juncture had another
more subtle and more important result. For by the grants which he made to the rural
gentry, he laid the basis for the foundation of a territorial aristocracy, destined
at a later day to wrest from the Crown the power which he had wrung from the older
nobility, lay and clerical. This after-effect of Cromwell’s policy, which was in
direct opposition to the aims of his government, did not take place till long after
his fall. It was rendered possible solely by the movement of events over which he
had no control, and he could have scarcely anticipated it. But it is only fair to
mention it here, in order that we may be able to look on the suppression of the
monasteries and its after-effects as a connected whole. If we do this, the cruelty
and treachery of Cromwell and his agents in gaining their ends will not make us
blind to the fact, that in the end the destruction of the religious houses in
England certainly accomplished other and better results than those it was originally
intended to compass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE PILGRIMAGE OF GRACE. 1536</p>

<p>When Cromwell entered the King’s service, it was inevitable that the policy he
adopted should force him to abandon all hope of popularity with the people at
large, as soon as his real position became generally known. The efforts Henry and
his minister made to conceal the identity of the true author of the sweeping changes
of the years 1530–1534, bear testimony to the fact that they were both perfectly
well aware of the opposition the new measures must arouse in the minds of those
who were outside the Court circle and consequently could not see the reason of
them. For a long time these efforts were crowned with success. We have seen that
it was not until the year 1535 that those who were in close proximity to the King
discovered what a power Cromwell had become in Church and State. It was even longer
before the country people began to realize the true state of affairs. News of the
extraordinary revolution in ecclesiastical matters, of the King’s divorce and
second marriage, of the packed Parliaments, and of the ruthless execution of so-called
heretics, slowly spread among the rural population. The changes were certainly
unwelcome, but they were universally thought to be the work of the King alone, and
traditional English respect for royalty was sufficient to check any serious outbreak.
The common people contented themselves with vague murmurings and disloyal speeches
which were soon suppressed through the efficiency of Cromwell’s agents; and by the
opening of the year 1535 the King and his minister began to hope that the crisis
had been tided over.</p>

<p>But they were destined to be disappointed. At the very moment when he began to
think himself secure in his almost exclusive enjoyment of his master’s favour,
Cromwell took a measure which was destined to conduce directly to the formidable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
rising that nearly hurled him from his hard-won place. The moment the Vicar-general
sent out his agents to visit the monasteries, the Englishman of the country began
to realize that the puzzling changes, of which he had hitherto understood so little,
were going to have an important and also a disagreeable effect on his own life. Up
to this time he had been unwilling actively to express his dissatisfaction at the
new measures, because they had seemed but remotely connected with his own fortunes:
but now there came an evidence to the contrary which he did not fail to appreciate.
The army of outcast monks and nuns, from whom in old days he had been accustomed
to receive every sort of kindness, now passed his door, begging for food and shelter.
The spoil which he had perhaps filched from the monastery suppressed near by, had
not been sufficient to repay him for the injury to the inmates whom he had been
taught to love and respect. His griefs are vividly described in the following verses
of a song written for the Yorkshire rebels in the autumn of 1536:</p>

<p class="pn">Such were the complaints which arose among the country folk as a
result of the suppression of the monasteries. And just at the moment that this
intensely unpopular measure began to be carried out in earnest, and largely as a
result of it, the veil which had hitherto prevented the people from recognizing
the true author of the hated innovations was torn away, and a pretext was offered
for a revolt, which had it been directed against the King, would have been no
better than treason. The people fastened on Cromwell as the author of all their
troubles; and the thought that a man whom they knew to be low-born, of no better
or more noble origin than themselves, had been able to cause them such misery, was
enough to kindle a smouldering fire of discontent into a brilliant blaze. A
crusade against Cromwell, they argued, could not be regarded as a revolt against
the royal authority. They had no complaint against the King, or even against any
of the nobles, but they were determined to rid themselves at one blow of the
plebeian minister whom they thoroughly detested and whom they had no cause to
respect: with the destruction of Cromwell and his agents, they were certain that
the good old days would return. The last verse of their war-song contained a frank
avowal of their object:</p>

<p>The reasons why the rising against the authority of Cromwell, known to posterity
by the suggestive name of the Pilgrimage of Grace, was organized, and set afoot in
the northern counties, are not far to seek. In the first place devotion to the Old
Faith, and to the cause of Queen Katherine, was far stronger in the north than in
the south of England.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> A
comparison of the ‘comperta’ of the northern and southern monasteries, or of the
details of the different visitations, will easily convince the reader of this
discrepancy. In the south occur constant complaints by the monks that their
superiors failed to observe the canons of religious asceticism; and on the other
hand, whenever an abbot refused to acknowledge the Royal Supremacy, his subordinates
were always sure to report him to head quarters, in the hope of gaining favour
with the King or Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_438_438"/><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>.
The letters of Dr. Legh from the south of England contain frequent reports of
‘towardness’ among the inmates, and willingness to adopt the New Faith<a id="FNanchor_439_439"/><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>.
In the north one finds none of this. The reports concerning the monasteries there
are of a very different sort: immorality and unnatural crimes are the principal
charges against the inmates<a id="FNanchor_440_440"/><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>.
There is scarcely a record of apostasy; scarcely a case of mutual accusation among
the monks. The abbots and their subordinates almost invariably supported each
other, and their loyalty to the Old Faith and their hatred of those who tried to
disestablish it, gave the Commissioners a far harder task in the north than in the
south. There is also reason to think that Cromwell’s spy system operated less
perfectly there, partly owing to this spirit of conservatism and love of the old
usages permeating every sort and condition of life, and partly owing to the great
spaces of wild, uninhabited land.</p>

<p>This is only the religious side. But there were other almost equally valid
reasons for the localization of the revolt in the north. The south was thickly
populated, and to a certain extent commercial; the north sparsely populated, and
for the most part pastoral and agricultural. Cromwell had done everything that he
could to facilitate trade, and his efforts in this direction had been rewarded by
comparative popularity in the commercial counties. The discontent in the agricultural
north, however, was most pronounced. The Statute of Uses had not been in all cases
correctly interpreted. It was said that the King made such laws that when a man
died his wife and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span> children
had to go a-begging<a id="FNanchor_441_441"/><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a>.
Lastly, the proximity of the Scottish Borders, which were in a continual state of
disorder, offered great encouragement for undertaking a rebellion in the north.
Cromwell was constantly occupied with the suppression of minor disturbances
there<a id="FNanchor_442_442"/><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>,
owing to the very lax administration of the Courts and Wardens of the three
Marches, while across the Tweed an attitude of more or less active hostility to
the English government was always maintained. There was every probability that a
revolt in the northern counties of the realm would receive substantial aid from Scotland.</p>

<p>But though the Pilgrimage of Grace was locally restricted to the northern
counties, it embraced all classes, animated by the most varied interests<a id="FNanchor_443_443"/><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a>.
The objects of the insurgents were secular and religious, their mottoes conservative
and progressive. On their banners were borne the emblems of the five wounds of
Christ, a chalice and a host, a plough, and a horn. The first of these symbols
indicated that the insurrection had been undertaken for the defence of the faith;
the second was to remind the commons of the spoils of the Church. The plough was
to encourage the husbandmen, and ‘the horn was in token of Horncastle’: for the
banner ‘was brought among the rebels by the commons of Horncastle<a id="FNanchor_444_444"/><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>.’
The watchwords of the rebels were of the very most diverse nature. Some of them
cried out for the restoration of the suppressed monasteries; others for the renewal
of guarantees against exorbitant taxation, for remedies for the agrarian discontent,
or for legal permission to leave land by will to daughters and younger sons. All
of them united in demanding the destruction of Cromwell, whom the people regarded
as the cause of all their woes<a id="FNanchor_445_445"/><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a>.
The leaders and participants in the revolt were not of any one rank or station in
life; the popular and aristocratic elements were almost equally mixed. It is no
wonder that a rising,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
supported by men of such various classes, which aimed at the extirpation of abuses
of so many different sorts, and which yet was united by the feeling that all these
abuses were due to one man alone, was regarded as ‘the daungerest insurrection
that haith ben seen<a id="FNanchor_446_446"/><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>.’</p>

<p>On September 29, 1536, when the Commissioners for the suppression of the
monasteries came to Hexham in Northumberland, they were rudely surprised by
finding the house there fortified, and prepared to defend itself to the last. The
Commissioners left the town and reported the affair to the King, who ordered them
to assemble all the forces they could muster, and if the monastery did not yield,
to treat the monks like arrant traitors<a id="FNanchor_447_447"/><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>.
But scarcely was this danger past when news came that the Commissioners for
levying the lay subsidy, the collection of which was superintended by Cromwell,
had met with a similar experience at Caistor in Lincolnshire. It seems they had
feared some disturbance at their arrival, and had invited several country gentlemen
to join them in case of any danger. A large force had meantime assembled to resist
the payment of the subsidy. The country gentlemen were pursued, taken, and forced
to write to Lord Hussey at Sleaford, to summon him to join the rebel commons,
unless he wished to be treated as an enemy, and also to send to the King to seek a
general pardon<a id="FNanchor_448_448"/><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>.
Hussey promptly reported the state of affairs to Cromwell, and though he put a
bold face on the matter in presence of the rebels, it is evident that he was
seriously alarmed<a id="FNanchor_449_449"/><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a>.
The King meantime himself received the letter the captured gentlemen had been
forced to send him, caused the bearers of it to reveal the names of the ringleaders,
and wrote to the Commissioners for levying the subsidy, expressing his distress at
the ‘vnnatural vnkyndness’ of his subjects, and marvelling ‘that he that is worth
xx li sholde rebell for the payment of x s<a id="FNanchor_450_450"/><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a>.’
But this sort of letter of mild surprise, with which Henry had sometimes successfully
warded off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> pressing danger,
did not prove to be sufficient in this case. He was relieved from any apprehension
on his own account; the rebels had expressly denied any desire to be disloyal to
the King: they only wished that the Church of England should have its old privileges,
‘without any exaction,’ that the suppressed houses of religion be restored, and
that they should not be taxed, except for defence of the realm in time of war.
Again and again did they repeat their demands for the surrender or banishment of
Cromwell, Audley, Cranmer, Riche, and others of the Privy Council. That the King
did not throw over his ministers in their hour of need, surely shows that Henry
was committed to them and to their policy, and believed in it.</p>

<p>The situation was certainly alarming. It was very fortunate that at the time of
the outbreak the position of the King was otherwise so strong, and England’s
foreign affairs in such good condition, that every effort could be centred on the
suppression of the revolt. The insurgents evidently meant business. Sir Christopher
Ascugh, gentleman usher to the King, wrote to Cromwell, October 6, ‘The rebels ar
in nombre of men of armys well harnesyd x or xii m spars and bows; &amp; xxx m other
sum harnesyd and sum not harnesyd <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and all the contrey Rysys holly as they

&amp; Baytyd Bellowe to deth wyth Dogg<i>es</i> wyth a bull skyn vpon his bake
wyth many Regorous word<i>es</i> agaynst your lordeshepp<a id="FNanchor_451_451"/><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a>.’
Letters were sent to the principal men in the county, asking them to use all their
efforts to check the revolt, and the King later declared his intention to take the
field himself<a id="FNanchor_452_452"/><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>.
Cromwell’s nephew Richard<a id="FNanchor_453_453"/><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a>
got all the arrows and implements of war out of the Tower, and dispatched a number
of men to Lincolnshire, among them sixty or eighty masons and carpenters, who were
at work on his uncle’s house. Cromwell himself was in great fear. The Imperial
ambassador informs us<a id="FNanchor_454_454"/><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>
that the whole blame for the insurrection was laid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
on him. Norfolk was recalled to the Court, whence he had been banished at Cromwell’s
suggestion, and the Duke arrived at London, happy as he had never been before in
the thought that the first step towards the ruin of his rival had been taken. But
in this he was doomed to disappointment, for Cromwell retained his ascendancy; the
King, according to Chapuys, had been very reluctant to send for the Duke, and when
the latter was dispatched again to raise men and prevent the spreading of the
revolt, he was overtaken by a most ‘discomfortable’ message from the Court, ordering
him to send his son in his place while he himself remained at home<a id="FNanchor_455_455"/><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>.
Cromwell had not only succeeded in getting him away from the Court, but had also
prevented his having a hand in the suppression of the rebellion. The Lord Privy
Seal himself was content with maintaining his position at the King’s side. It
would have been sheer madness for him to have marched against the rebels in person.
If the Lincolnshire men could have murdered him, they probably would have been
induced to return quietly to their homes. Nor did Cromwell even dare to give
orders at arm’s length, or in any way to undertake the management of the royal
forces. He kept himself consistently in the background; almost all our information
concerning the rebellion is contained in the correspondence of the King with
Norfolk and Suffolk. The few letters which Cromwell did write in connexion with
the Pilgrimage of Grace are quite unimportant<a id="FNanchor_456_456"/><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>.
They consist for the most part of messages of profuse and almost hysterical thanks
to the leaders of the King’s party for their loyal service. It was not until the
revolt had been thoroughly suppressed that Cromwell ventured again to assume the
general direction of public affairs.</p>

<p>Meantime the Duke of Suffolk and the Earl of Shrewsbury had been sent against
the rebels, who were waiting in Lincolnshire for the King’s answer to their first
letter. Richard Cromwell had found great difficulty in conveying to the scene the
arms and artillery he had got out of the Tower, because the people were at first
unwilling to furnish the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
requisite number of horses, owing to sympathy with the insurgents, if one may
believe the report of Chapuys’ nephew<a id="FNanchor_457_457"/><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>.
Finally, however, he succeeded in overtaking the Duke of Suffolk, who was marching
with an army against the rebels from the south, at Stamford on October 10. The
Earl of Shrewsbury, according to the King’s orders, was advancing at the same time
from Nottingham. Caught between two armies supplied with the ordnance which the
insurgents so much dreaded, the Lincolnshire men, further frightened by a proclamation
from the Earl of Shrewsbury transmitted to them by one Thomas Miller, Lancaster
Herald, began to lose heart and finally consented to surrender, on condition that
they should receive assurance of merciful treatment. The King was pleased, ordered
the rebels to deliver up their arms, and commanded Shrewsbury and Suffolk to
examine the country gentlemen who had aided them, and report to him<a id="FNanchor_458_458"/><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>.
He further wrote an answer to the insurgents, calling them the ‘rude commons of
one shire, and that one of the most brute and beestelie of the hole realme<a id="FNanchor_459_459"/><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>,’
expatiating on the trouble he had given himself in their defence, and assuring
them that they had no grounds to complain of any of the new measures, either
secular or religious. He was just thinking that the worst part of the danger was
over, when suddenly news came from Lord Darcy, who was the chief person in the
north, that all Yorkshire had risen in a similar way<a id="FNanchor_460_460"/><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>.</p>

<p>The news of this outbreak was even more disquieting than that of the first.
Besides being much further from London, where the King’s armies could only reach
them with great difficulty, the Yorkshire rebels were nearer the lawless and
hostile Scottish borders. They had from the very first been in sympathy with their
neighbours in the south, and had communicated with them by means of beacons burned
on the banks of the Humber<a id="FNanchor_461_461"/><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>.
The same motives had prompted them to rise in arms. They elected as captain a
young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> barrister named Aske,
who issued a proclamation for all men to assemble on Skipworth Moor, and take oath
to be faithful to the King’s issue and noble blood, to preserve the Church from
spoil, and be true to the commonwealth—a clever euphemism for demanding the death
of Cromwell and his adherents. The Yorkshiremen had gone about their revolt with
far more method and system than the Lincolnshire rebels. The latter had been easily
conquered, mainly because they lacked a head; but the Yorkshiremen promised to
give far more trouble. They made musters by scrolls and bills nailed to the door
of every church in the county, and proclaimed that any one who refused to take
their oaths and rise with them should be put to death, whether he was lord or
peasant. It was even rumoured that they intended to send an embassy to Flanders,
to ask for aid in money and armed men, and to petition the Pope for absolution
for all offences committed in the course of their holy pilgrimage<a id="FNanchor_462_462"/><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>.</p>

<p>The King replied at once to Darcy’s letter, commanding him to arrest all
seditious persons, and promising so to treat the originators of the revolt in
Lincolnshire that all York should soon learn that they had got their deserts<a id="FNanchor_463_463"/><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>.
Darcy wrote to the Lord Mayor of York, warning him to be prepared to resist the
insurgents, while he himself proceeded to Pomfret Castle to hold it against the
rebels, and there awaited further instructions from the King<a id="FNanchor_464_464"/><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>.
He succeeded in maintaining his position at Pomfret for only ten days however, for
on October 20 he surrendered the town to the rebel army under the leadership of
Aske, and together with the Archbishop of York, who had sought refuge there, swore
to take part with the insurgents<a id="FNanchor_465_465"/><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>.
At his trial in the following year he pleaded that he was unable to hold out any
longer because the provisions had run short, and further stated that he had been
compelled to side with the rebels under pain of death. He also alleged as an
excuse for his conduct that he thought that if he got in touch with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
insurgents, he could the more easily induce them to lay down their arms. How loyal
he really was to the King must remain a matter of conjecture, but there is strong
reason to think that he had much sympathy with the revolt<a id="FNanchor_466_466"/><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>.</p>

<p>For a time the rebels seemed to carry all before them. Shrewsbury had been
ordered to go to Yorkshire and engage the insurgents there, now that Lincolnshire
was regarded as safe. Meantime Thomas Miller, Lancaster Herald, who had been so
successful in obtaining the submission of the Lincolnshire men, was sent by the
King from Scrooby, on October 21, to read a royal proclamation to the rebels at
Pomfret, upbraiding them for their conduct, but promising them pardon on condition
that they should immediately disperse. When he arrived at his destination the town
had been surrendered. Aske, although he treated the royal envoy with all due
respect, entirely refused to let him read his proclamation in public, and sent him
away with two crowns and his errand unaccomplished<a id="FNanchor_467_467"/><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>.</p>

<p>Meantime the Duke of Norfolk, who two weeks before had returned sadly to
Kenninghall with all his hopes of regaining the royal favour blighted, had been
hurried to and fro in the south of England by a continued stream of conflicting
orders from Cromwell and the King, until he finally heard of the disturbances in
Yorkshire from Shrewsbury<a id="FNanchor_468_468"/><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>.
He immediately turned his steps with a small company of men towards Doncaster, in
the hope of regaining the King’s favour by a prompt suppression of the new
outbreak. So anxious was he to recommend himself to Henry, that he spent £1,500 of
his own in paying the wages of the King’s soldiers; and when this was not
sufficient, and Henry refused to advance any money, he asked for a loan to meet
the expenses, and took the responsibility for its payment upon himself<a id="FNanchor_469_469"/><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a>.
Norfolk’s whole proceeding in this crisis was eminently characteristic. He never
hesitated to spend money or to tell lies, if he thought that by so doing there was
any possibility of gaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
the royal favour. He assured the King that, in treating with rebels, he would pay
no respect to what others might call his ‘honour distayned,’ for he considered it
perfectly permissible to break promises in order to serve the Crown<a id="FNanchor_470_470"/><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>.
Henry, it would seem, did not take Norfolk’s treacherous proposals to sacrifice
his own honour in the royal service in as good part as the Duke had hoped, and
wrote back hinting that if Norfolk made promises to the rebels that he could not
keep, he must make them on his own responsibility, and take great care that the
King’s name remained unsullied.</p>

<p>When the Duke arrived in the rebel country he issued a proclamation to the
insurgents, commanding them in proud and haughty terms to submit, and promising to
be an intercessor for them with the King. This was on October 27. But the very
next day he wrote to Henry that he had been forced to declare to the insurgents
the royal pardon, in order to ‘sparple’ them, and get them to return to their
homes<a id="FNanchor_471_471"/><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>.
It is evident that in the meantime a meeting must have taken place between the
Duke and the rebels, in which the latter succeeded in convincing their enemy that
they, and not he, were in the position to dictate terms. A general truce was
arranged, and Lord Darcy was ordered to cease to molest the insurgents<a id="FNanchor_472_472"/><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a>.
The dread with which Norfolk awaited his first interview with the King is vividly
described in the letter in which he announced to the Council his prospective
return to the Court. ‘I come,’ wrote the Duke, ‘w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> my hert nere
bresten <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> inforced to appoynt with the rebell<i>es</i> <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and fearing how
his maieste shall take the dispeachyng of our bande<a id="FNanchor_473_473"/><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a>.’</p>

<p>Norfolk finally arrived at Windsor with two emissaries from the insurgents, who
were to report their grievances and receive the King’s answer. Henry was just
composing his reply when news came that Aske had attempted to stir up the rebels
in the other northern counties. Norfolk wrote to Darcy that the King suspected him
of treachery in delivering up Pomfret to Aske, and advised him to do his best
to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> ‘extinct the ill bruit,’
by taking the rebel leader dead or alive<a id="FNanchor_474_474"/><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a>.
Meantime the King detained Ellerker and Bowes, the two rebel envoys, as hostages,
while Darcy attempted to allay any fears of a third outbreak. The King in fact was
so seriously alarmed at the danger in the north, that he dreaded that his letter
to the Lincolnshire men in early October might not prove sufficient to prevent
their joining a new revolt, if such occurred. So seeing their ‘maner, implieng a
great repentance,’ and contrasting it with the rebellious attitude of the Yorkshiremen,
he sent them on the 14th of November a full pardon<a id="FNanchor_475_475"/><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>.
Meantime the report of the probability of a fresh insurrection passed by, and
Ellerker and Bowes returned with the King’s answer, with which Henry had taken
much trouble, and had endeavoured to disguise the fact that he was really suing
for peace, by promising to pardon those who were truly penitent. A conference for
discussion of terms was arranged to assemble at Doncaster on the 5th of December,
in which Lords Scrope, Latimer, Lumley, Darcy, and others were to represent the
rebels, and Norfolk, Suffolk, Shrewsbury, Rutland, and their subordinates the
King<a id="FNanchor_476_476"/><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>.</p>

<p>Henry laid his plans carefully in preparation for this meeting. He instructed
Shrewsbury to do his utmost to prevail upon Aske and Darcy to betray the rebels,
upon promise of a free pardon for themselves. He also ordered the Duke of Suffolk
to hold himself in readiness with a large force in case of another outbreak<a id="FNanchor_477_477"/><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a>.
There was probably far less danger that the truce would be broken by the rebels
than by the King; but the former certainly had no intention of returning to their
homes without at least an assurance of a general amnesty. Henry soon realized that
they were in earnest, and reluctantly instructed Suffolk, in a second letter, to
yield to their demands for a free pardon and a Parliament as a last resort, if all
other expedients to induce them to disperse should fail<a id="FNanchor_478_478"/><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a>.
The conference at Doncaster lasted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
four days, but in the end the rebels were successful in gaining their wishes, and
the desired pardon was proclaimed on the 9th of December<a id="FNanchor_479_479"/><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>.
Henry had never before been forced to acknowledge such a complete check at the
hands of his subjects, and the sensations of the proud King must have been as
disagreeable as they were novel. Still it was impossible for him to give vent to
his rage until he had once more obtained the upper hand.</p>

<p>So he wrote to Aske requesting an interview with him in London. The tone of the
letter is noteworthy. Though evidently beaten, Henry spoke as if he were master of
the situation, and began by stating that he had learned that Aske was sorry for
his offences in the late rebellion. The King also did his utmost to stop any
rumours on the Continent which might give the impression that the rebels had come
off victorious. He instructed Cromwell to write a full account of the revolt to
Gardiner and Wallop at the French Court, ordering them to tell all people that
though at first the insurgents ‘made petic<i>i</i>on to haue obteyned certain
articles, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> in thende they went from all and remytted all to the king<i>es</i>
highnes pleasure only in moost humble and reuerent sorte desiring their p<i>ar</i>don,
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the greatest repentance that could be deuised<a id="FNanchor_480_480"/><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>.’
But Henry was a little premature with his boasts that peace had been concluded on
terms so favourable to himself. Aske indeed came up to London, had what certainly
appeared to be a most successful interview with the King, and returned to the
North, January 5, 1537, to confirm the royal pardon, and to promise that all
reasonable petitions should be heard by Parliament<a id="FNanchor_481_481"/><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a>.
But the other rebels did not seem by any means as sure of Henry’s good faith. Aske
wrote to the King a letter containing six ‘marvilus congectures’ of the people,
among which were the dread with which they regarded the fortifying of strongholds,
and their distrust that Cromwell and his adherents were as high in favour as ever<a id="FNanchor_482_482"/><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a>.
Henry of course paid no attention to these complaints, with the result that many
of the insurgents,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> who ‘saw
plainly,’ as the Court historian writes, ‘that the King did constantly follow the
reformation of the abominable Church <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> incontinently renewed the old practice
of rebelling again<a id="FNanchor_483_483"/><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>.’
A plan was evolved by Sir Francis Bigod and a certain John Hallam, to attack and
take both Hull and Scarborough: the whole country was ready to rise again, and
they anticipated an easy victory<a id="FNanchor_484_484"/><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a>.
But the success of this last outbreak was very short-lived. The attempt which
Hallam made against Hull failed, owing to the fact that the plot had been reported
to the mayor there, and Hallam himself was captured<a id="FNanchor_485_485"/><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>.
At Scarborough Bigod was scarcely more fortunate. He had succeeded in calling out
the people of the East Riding, and had harangued them; ‘Ye are deceaued by a colo<i>ur</i>
of a pardon,’ he said, ‘for it is called a pardon that ye haue, and it is none But
a p<i>ro</i>clamacion.’ The commons responded to his words with a great shout, and
he marched off with a large following to repair his comrade’s disaster at Hull,
leaving the son of Lord Lumley with a handful of men to attack Scarborough<a id="FNanchor_486_486"/><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>.
But Lumley deserted his post, abandoning the command to two subordinates, who
attempted to lay siege to the castle of Scarborough in the absence of its keeper,
Sir Ralph Evers; the latter, however, soon returned, and they gave up the enterprise,
only to be captured and imprisoned. Bigod’s second attempt on Hull had meantime
also failed, and Bigod himself fled<a id="FNanchor_487_487"/><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>.</p>

<p>Meantime the Duke of Norfolk had returned into the north, no longer as a peace
commissioner, but as a messenger of death and destruction<a id="FNanchor_488_488"/><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>.
Now that the tide of affairs had turned and the rebels were weakened, the King
thought it at last safe to inflict the long-deferred punishment on the leaders of
the revolt. It is true that Norfolk was accompanied by a few persons, who together
with certain gentlemen in the north were to compose a council to aid him in carrying
out a general pacification: this arrangement, however, was obviously temporary,
and it was soon to be replaced by a more stable form<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
of government. The true mission of the Duke was to do ‘dreadful execution.’ Before
a permanent reorganization of the north could be attempted, it was absolutely
essential that the chief rebels should be dealt with in such a way as would deter
others from attempting a fresh insurrection. The situation demanded severity, and
there can be no doubt that the inclination of the King tallied closely with the
dictates of political expediency. Norfolk justified to the full the confidence
that Henry reposed in his ruthlessness. He reported that he thought that so great
a number had never before been put to death at one time, and confessed that had he
proceeded by jury, not one in five would have suffered<a id="FNanchor_489_489"/><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>.
All the rebel leaders were taken and sent up to London, and by the end of July,
1537, Aske, Darcy, Hussey, Bigod, and many others had been condemned to death as
traitors. Darcy at his mock trial had dared to tell Cromwell: ‘It is thow that art
the verey originall and chif causer of all thies rebellyon and myschif <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and
dust ernestly travell to bring vs to owr end and to strik of our hedd<i>es</i> and
I trust that <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> thought thow woldest procure all the nobell mens hedd<i>es</i>
within the Realme to be striken of, yet shall ther one hedde remayn that shall
strike of thy hede<a id="FNanchor_490_490"/><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a>.’
But the Lord Privy Seal was still in too secure a position to be harmed by any
such words as these. He seemed in higher favour than ever. If Norfolk had entertained
the notion that he had begun to supplant his rival in the royal favour, when the
King chose him rather than Cromwell to carry out the ‘dreadful execution,’ he was
again doomed to disappointment. The reason why the King had not been willing to
employ his favourite instrument of destruction in this case, lay for the most part
in the fact that he needed his aid in a far more important task, to which Norfolk’s
proceedings were merely a necessary preliminary. For the moment had now arrived
for the long-contemplated reform of the government of the north, a matter in which
the Duke vainly attempted to give advice. His proffered counsel was consistently
rejected:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> in dealing with
this problem the King preferred to consult Cromwell.</p>

<p>The Border Counties of England had never been governed like the rest of the
kingdom<a id="FNanchor_491_491"/><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>.
The institution of the three Scottish Marches, which at first included the greater
part of Northumberland and Cumberland, took its rise as early as the middle of the
thirteenth century. Each of these three Marches was placed in charge of a Warden,
who, aided by a special court, exercised general authority, judicial, military,
and administrative, according to his commission. There appears also at a very
early date a kind of informal conference or Council of the Marches, composed of
the ordinary March authorities, sitting in conjunction with local magnates. When
the war with Scotland broke out at the end of the thirteenth century, the King
attempted through the Privy Council to increase his personal influence in the
north. He did not disturb the existing organization however. By special commissions
he strengthened the power of the Wardens, and later gave the government of the
Marches a definite head in an officer called the Lieutenant of the North, who
represented the King’s interest, and derived his authority from the Crown and
Council and not from Parliament. The Border Counties were thus placed under a
special jurisdiction and outside the ordinary administration of the kingdom. The
tendency of the Privy Council to mingle in the affairs of the north increased
during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and (as a result of the strained
relations between England and Scotland in the early part of the reign of Henry
VIII.) reached its culmination under Wolsey. The Lieutenant’s control had meantime
been extended southward into Yorkshire.</p>

<p>It may perhaps seem strange that the Tudors, with their special genius for
centralization and conciliar government, had not yet succeeded in rendering the
condition of the north more satisfactory, when its administration lay so completely
in their own hands. But the ever-threatening danger of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
raid from the Scots, coupled with the bitter feuds of the local baronage, tended
so far to disorganize the region that the problem of the north had remained unsolved.
The attempt of Wolsey to reform the government of the Border Counties had consisted
in a thorough rehabilitation of the old Council of the Marches. He replaced the
ill-defined, loosely-constructed body which had hitherto done service by a secret,
permanent organization, composed principally of northern gentlemen, but still
entirely dependent on the Privy Council. His reluctance to grant the local organ a
sufficient degree of autonomy was the cause of the failure of his plan. The
renovated Council of the Marches was forced to confess itself incompetent to deal
with even the simplest problems which presented themselves for solution, and the
old unsatisfactory state of affairs continued with little change, until after the
Pilgrimage of Grace.</p>

<p>The problem of the reorganization of the north was now vigorously attacked by
Henry and Cromwell during the absence of Norfolk. The question which presented
itself after the suppression of the revolt was whether it would be better to
create an entirely new form of government for the north, or to reconstruct, readapt,
and strengthen the old. The principle of control by a permanent local council,
first definitely established by Wolsey, was essentially characteristic of the Tudor
policy, and Henry and Cromwell saw no reason to depart from it. It had been one of
the chief sources of the strength of their rule, that though they never shrank
from any change, however radical, which the demands of a royal despotism in Church
and State rendered necessary, they carefully avoided any gratuitous innovations
which they knew would be unwelcome to the people at large. An entirely fresh
organization of the north would have been exceedingly unpopular, especially in
that most conservative portion of England: it was far less obnoxious, and equally
effective, to infuse new life into the old régime, by granting the Council of the
Marches a sufficient degree of independence, and above all by changing its composition.
The problem was in many respects similar to that with which Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
had been confronted in connexion with the election of bishops. No radical
innovation was needed in either case; the <i>status quo</i>, when fortified by
official sanction, was perfectly satisfactory, save for a few trifling readaptations.
It was on this basis accordingly, that Henry and Cromwell resolved to reconstruct
the government of the Border Counties. The old forms were retained though under
different names. The jurisdiction of the Council of the North (merely a new version
of the old Council of the Marches) was extended so as to include the counties of
Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmoreland, York, and Durham. It was given wider
competence in general administration, and its judicial authority in certain cases
was so strengthened as to exclude that of the ordinary courts in the districts in
which it exercised its functions<a id="FNanchor_492_492"/><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>.</p>

<p>Far more interesting for our purpose than the jurisdiction of the newly-organized
Council, is its composition, especially as revealing the identity of its originator.
It seems that the new body was largely composed of men of low birth, a certain indication
that Cromwell’s was the guiding hand in its organization<a id="FNanchor_493_493"/><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>.
The ‘base-born knave’ at whose feet England lay had succeeded in proving to the King,
that he and others of humble origin had as much power and willingness to serve the
Crown as any nobleman in the land. Moreover the personal character of many of the
members of the new Council was not above reproach, and though this fact does not seem
to have disturbed the King, a bitter protest was evoked from Cromwell’s rival, the
Duke of Norfolk, who, from his isolated position in the north, had watched with increasing
impatience the success of the Lord Privy Seal in maintaining his influence at Court,
and in organizing a body obviously intended to supplant the temporary council composed
in the previous January. Norfolk’s anxiety to recommend himself to the King had alone
induced him to take upon himself the task of punishing the revolt; now that he discovered
that with all his subserviency Cromwell had again stepped into the place which he
had coveted for himself, his enthusiasm for executing rebels gave place to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
petitions to be permitted to return to Court. But Cromwell was strong enough to keep
him in the north till September, and the Duke was forced to content himself with writing
letters to the King and Council, to complain of the new arrangements for the government
of the Borders which had been made in his absence<a id="FNanchor_494_494"/><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>.
He and Cromwell came into collision here, just as they had done before over Irish
affairs: each had his own idea as to the best method of government in both cases,
and the antagonism of the two men was the sharper in that each knew that his favour
with the King depended on the success of his plan of administration. The Duke from
the very first was convinced that ‘the wylde peple of all the Marches wolde not be
kept in order vnles one of good estimacion and nobilitie have the ordering therof,’
while Cromwell and the Council asserted that the King had already been ill served on
the Borders ‘by <i>th</i>e reason of controversy &amp; variaunce depending between
<i>th</i>e great men <i>tha</i>t ly upon <i>th</i>e same’; but, they continued, ‘if
it shal please his M<i>ajesty</i> to appoynt <i>th</i>e meanest man <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> to rule
&amp; govern in <i>tha</i>t place; is not his Graces aucthoritie sufficient to cause
al men to serve his Grace under him w<i>i</i>thout respect of <i>th</i>e very
estate of <i>th</i>e personage?<a id="FNanchor_495_495"/><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>’
The dispute on this point began in early February, when Norfolk wrote to protest
against certain names in a list of officers for the north which the Privy Council
had sent him. ‘More arraunt thev<i>es</i> and murderers be not in no Realme,’
asserted the Duke, ‘then they haue of Long tyme been and yet ar <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and the same
shall not only cause Light p<i>er</i>soun<i>es</i> to saye and beleve that the
King<i>es</i> Highnes is fayne to Hire with Fees the moost malefactors <span class="larger">‹</span>in order<span class="larger">›</span>
to syt in rest, but also not to Loke vppon theire most detestable offenc<i>es</i><a id="FNanchor_496_496"/><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a>.’
An animated correspondence on this topic continued for several months, the dispute
finally centering about the Presidency of the new Council and the Wardenships of
the three Marches; Norfolk insisted that only noblemen were fitted to hold these
offices<a id="FNanchor_497_497"/><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>.
In<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[200]</a></span> May the discussion was
finally closed by the King, who had steadily supported the position adopted by
Cromwell and the Council. Henry now took the matter into his own hands, and sent a
peremptory letter to the Duke. ‘We doo accept in good p<i>ar</i>te,’ wrote the
King, ‘the declarac<i>i</i>on of yo<i>ur</i> opinion for the March<i>es</i>.
Neuertheles we doubt not but you woll both conforme yo<i>ur</i> owne mynde to
fynde out the good order whiche we haue therin determyned and cause other by your
good meane to p<i>er</i>ceyve the same. For surely we woll not be bounde of a
necessitie to be s<i>er</i>ued there with lord<i>es</i>, But we wolbe s<i>er</i>ued
with such men what degre soeuer they be of as we shall appointe to the same<a id="FNanchor_498_498"/><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>.’
The Presidency of the Council was finally conferred on Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop
of Durham. The death of the Earl of Northumberland in June, 1537, served as a
convenient pretext for the suppression of the Lord Wardenship of the East and
Middle Marches, which that nobleman had previously enjoyed; and the Earl of
Cumberland, who had hitherto held a similar office on the West Marches, was not
permitted long to retain it. Three Deputy Wardens, Sir William Evers, Sir John
Witherington, and Sir Thomas Wharton, were appointed in their places by the King
and Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_499_499"/><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>; the three March Courts were revived, and exercised concurrent
jurisdiction with the new Council<a id="FNanchor_500_500"/><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>,
which was also composed as Henry and his minister had originally planned it<a id="FNanchor_499_499a"/><a href="#Footnote_499_499a" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>.
In every point the advice of Cromwell had been taken in preference to that of
Norfolk, and when the Duke finally obtained leave to return to Court in September,
it must have been with the feeling that he had again suffered defeat at the hands
of his plebeian rival. The rebellion, which eleven months before had threatened to
hurl Cromwell from his place, had been completely quelled, and the country had
been again reduced to internal quiet. The danger while it lasted had indeed been
pressing, but so firmly had Cromwell been established as the King’s chief minister
by the events of the years 1530 to 1536, that the storm passed over him and left
him scath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>less. The failure
of the Pilgrimage of Grace and the process of reconstruction which followed it,
bore witness to the thoroughness with which he had carried out his main aim in
internal government, and to the security of the position to which he had elevated
himself by his temporary success in establishing a royal despotism.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">CARDINAL POLE</p>

<p>The story of the life of Reginald Pole and of the destruction of his illustrious
family will always be inseparably bound up with the history of Thomas Cromwell.
It affords the most striking example of the unscrupulous policy of the King’s
minister towards those who stood in the way of the royal despotism in Church and
State. It forms moreover a valuable connecting link between the internal and
foreign administration of the time, as it concerns itself with nearly all the
great problems which Cromwell had to face.</p>

<p>To turn for a moment to the earlier history of Pole; he was born in March, 1500,
the fourth son of Sir Richard Pole, and his wife Margaret, Countess of Salisbury<a id="FNanchor_501_501"/><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>.
In his youth Henry had helped him forward in his education, paying twelve pounds
for his maintenance at school, and later obtaining for him a pension from the
Prior of St. Frideswide’s, while he was an undergraduate at Magdalen College<a id="FNanchor_502_502"/><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a>.
Subsequently, by the royal munificence Pole was enabled to go to Italy, where he
worked with the foremost scholars of the time<a id="FNanchor_503_503"/><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>.
He returned to England in 1527 and there received many marks of distinction, but
wishing to continue his studies, he soon removed to Paris. Henry was particularly
anxious that the University there should pronounce in favour of the divorce, and
with some difficulty induced Pole to carry on negotiations with it to that intent.
When the University finally came to the decision that the King desired, Pole received
a hearty letter of commendation and was subsequently induced to return to
England<a id="FNanchor_504_504"/><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></p>

<p>Henry now urged him openly to support the divorce, and offered him as an
inducement the archbishopric of York, which had been left vacant at Wolsey’s death,
but in vain. Pole firmly refused to approve of the King’s new measures, saying
that to do so would be inconsistent with his principles<a id="FNanchor_505_505"/><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>.
A little later he witnessed the concessions wrung from the clergy concerning the
Royal Supremacy, and was not slow to perceive that it was by Cromwell’s agency
that the entire ecclesiastical system of the country had been overthrown. He called
to mind the conversation he had held years before with the ‘Satanae Nuncius,’ when
the latter had dared to uphold the superiority of Machiavelli’s doctrines to the
scholastic learning, and soon became convinced that England was not a safe place
for a man of his ideas, while such a person as Cromwell was in power. He accordingly
requested leave to continue his study of theology abroad, and obtained Henry’s
consent<a id="FNanchor_506_506"/><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>.</p>

<p>He settled down at Padua, and there lived the quiet life of a scholar until
1535, when the King determined to find out about him. He sought information
concerning Pole and his beliefs from one Thomas Starkey, who had long been an
intimate of the future Cardinal. In answer to the King’s inquiries Starkey sent
back an imaginary dialogue between Pole and his companion Lupset, in which the
former was represented as opposed on principle to a royal despotism, but still
personally faithful to Henry VIII. The King, however, was not contented with this
vague and half-contradictory reply, and caused Starkey to write again to Pole and
ask him honestly to express his views about the divorce and the Royal Supremacy<a id="FNanchor_507_507"/><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a>.
To this Pole responded in May, 1536, with a letter enclosing his famous treatise,
‘De Unitate Ecclesiae,’ which he sent by his faithful servant Michael Throgmorton<a id="FNanchor_508_508"/><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>.
This work fulfilled all too perfectly Henry’s request for a candid opinion; so
plain were its expressions of disapproval, that even Starkey himself felt obliged
to write to the King to say how much he had been shocked by its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
violence<a id="FNanchor_509_509"/><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a>.
Henry dissembled his anger, and sent Throgmorton back to Pole with a message
urging him to come home in order that he might talk with him more fully. The King
took good care to make Throgmorton himself promise to return in any case<a id="FNanchor_510_510"/><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a>.
Coupled with the King’s message came a letter of reproof from Pole’s mother, which
had evidently been written at Henry’s command<a id="FNanchor_511_511"/><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>.
This letter aroused Pole’s suspicions and he refused to return, alleging as his
excuse the fact that the King enforced with ‘sore severitie’ a law by which any
man who would not consent to his supremacy was declared a traitor. It appears from
Pole’s reply that Cromwell had also written to him, ‘to styrr hym the more
vehemently.’ If the letter of the King’s minister was half as savage and threatening
as those which he later wrote, it is no wonder that Pole was alarmed.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of December, 1536, Pole much against his will was created Cardinal
at Rome, and two months later was appointed Papal legate to England<a id="FNanchor_512_512"/><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a>.
It appears that in spite of the Ten Articles the Pope had not yet given up all
hope of re-establishing his power in Henry’s dominions, and had determined to make
use of Pole as the most likely means of accomplishing this end. The news of the
latter’s new dignity and of the Papal intentions against England was received with
dread at the King’s Court. It was remembered that as far back as 1512 a prophecy
had been made to the effect, ‘that one with a Red Cap brought up from low degree
to high estate should rule all the land under the King, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and afterwards
procure the King to take another wife, divorce his lawful wife, Queen Catherina,
and involve the land in misery’; and that further ‘that divorce should lead to the
utter fall of the said Red Cap <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> and after much misery the land should by
another Red Cap be reconciled, or else brought to utter destruction<a id="FNanchor_513_513"/><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>.’
We are told that Cromwell knew this prophecy well, and that he often discussed it,
and sought to learn whether the last part of it should some day come to pass, as
he had seen the first fulfilled in his own time. Had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Pole been able to arrive in England promptly, so that he could have taken advantage
of the disturbance caused by Bigod’s rebellion, it is possible that Cromwell’s
fears might have been realized before his death, and that a reconciliation with
Rome might have taken place in 1537 instead of in 1554. But the bull of legation
was unaccountably delayed till the 31st of March<a id="FNanchor_514_514"/><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>.
Meantime the northern revolt had been crushed, Francis and Charles were still at
war, and Pole’s chance had gone. By this time Henry had doubtless perceived that
the new-made Cardinal could never be induced to support his cause, but would
certainly oppose it as long as he lived. As reconciliation seemed impossible, the
King turned his thoughts to arrest or execution. The foreign affairs of England at
that juncture were in such a favourable condition that Henry felt strong enough to
dictate both to the Emperor and to the King of France. Informed by the latter (who
was just then in terror of losing England’s friendship because of his war with
Charles) that Pole was coming through France with money to help the northern
rebels, Henry was bold enough to demand in answer that he should not be received
as a legate, and also that he should be extradited as a traitor; he also wrote to
Gardiner at Paris to keep ‘good espyall’ on his movements<a id="FNanchor_515_515"/><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>.
A letter from Sir Thomas Palmer, a somewhat quarrelsome knight at Calais, would
seem to indicate that a plot to apprehend or assassinate Pole had been set on foot
as early as the spring of 1537, and Cromwell in a letter to Gardiner of May 18
further discusses the matter<a id="FNanchor_516_516"/><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>.
Pole, however, had been advised of these treacherous schemes, and had escaped
first to Cambray and later to the palace of the Cardinal of Liège, where he remained,
grieved and mortified at the failure of his mission, but perfectly safe from
Cromwell’s assassins<a id="FNanchor_517_517"/><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>.
Returning thence to Rome at the Pope’s command, he reported the unsuccessful
result of his journey in October.</p>

<p>Meantime in January, 1537, Michael Throgmorton had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fulfilled his promise and returned to England<a id="FNanchor_518_518"/><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>.
If Henry had once thought that Pole’s servant would put his loyalty to the Crown before
his faithfulness to his master<a id="FNanchor_519_519"/><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a>,
he must have been convinced of his mistake by this time; but Throgmorton was saved
from punishment for the present by Henry’s temporary failure to subdue the
Pilgrimage of Grace, and anxiety lest fresh hostility should be aroused abroad;
and was soon sent back to carry to his master a final warning to desist from
attacking the Royal Supremacy<a id="FNanchor_520_520"/><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a>.
From this errand Throgmorton did not return; it would have been the act of a
madman to do so, considering the way in which events were moving. Instead, he
wrote two long and conciliatory letters to Cromwell, one from Rome on February 15,
the other from Liège on August 20<a id="FNanchor_521_521"/><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>.
In the first he attempted to appease the anger of the King, which had been aroused
by Pole’s acceptance of the Cardinalate. In the second he insisted that Pole had
always done his utmost for the advancement of the King’s honour and good name,
except in matters which concerned the unity of the Church. Furthermore he pointed
out that though Henry had treated him as a rebel and put a price upon his head,
the Cardinal had shown great forbearance in not leaving his book against the King
in the hands of the Pope, who would infallibly have published it, and in refusing
the exercise of certain censures which had been prepared against Henry in Rome.
Throgmorton added, moreover, that the Pope had just called Pole back to Italy to
take part in the General Council appointed for the following November, at which it
was inevitable that strong measures would be taken against England. He assured
Cromwell that if the King desired to avoid this danger it would be indispensable
for him to become reconciled to Pole, on whose attitude at the Council so much
depended. Throgmorton appears to have supplemented this letter with a verbal
suggestion that a conference should be arranged between the King’s chaplain Dr.
Wilson and the Cardinal, before the latter’s departure for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
Rome, in the hope that some final agreement might be reached. He promised to use
his own efforts to induce Pole to do his part, and seized the opportunity to
excuse himself for not returning to England, by observing in this connexion that
he could best further the King’s interests by tarrying with his master. At first
the plan which Throgmorton proposed seems to have found acceptance with Henry. A
favourable reply was drawn up by Cromwell, and Dr. Wilson and his companion, Dr.
Nicholas Heath, received instructions preparatory to a conference with Pole<a id="FNanchor_522_522"/><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a>.
But though Henry, discouraged as he was by his failures to kill or capture the
Cardinal, appears to have been momentarily persuaded that Throgmorton’s suggestion
was feasible, his minister from the first was strongly opposed to it. The first
draft of the reply to the letter of Pole’s servant bears every evidence of having
been written under compulsion, and Cromwell must have succeeded, before it was
actually sent, in persuading the King that a mission which was to meet the Cardinal
on his own ground could only result in failure, and that the sole thing to do was
openly to menace Pole and his family with assassination. Such at least seems the
most probable explanation of the fact that Wilson and Heath never started on their
errand, and of the singularly abusive and malevolent letter with which Cromwell
finally replied to that of Throgmorton<a id="FNanchor_523_523"/><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a>.
The last hope of reconciliation with the Cardinal had vanished; not he alone, but
also his aged mother and brother in England, had been threatened with destruction.
Another obstacle to Henry’s despotism was to be annihilated, as every attempt to
surmount it had failed.</p>

<p>Pole meanwhile remained in Italy, assured of his personal safety but grieved to the
heart that his mother and brother were still in England, where the King could take
vengeance on them for his own alleged treason. In August, 1538, his brother, Sir
Geoffrey Pole, was arrested and placed in the Tower, where he was examined on the
charge of having had treacherous correspondence with his brother Reginald, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
having interfered with the King’s endeavours to arrest him<a id="FNanchor_524_524"/><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a>.
His replies to the questions put to him implicated many others, and before the
close of the year the heads of the powerful families of Montague, Courtenay,
Delawarr, and Nevill had been arrested and sent to the Tower<a id="FNanchor_525_525"/><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>.
There is reason to believe that the confessions of Sir Geoffrey Pole were extorted
from him by threats of torture, to serve as an excuse for the arrest of these
noblemen, and a letter of Castillon to Montmorency asserts that their destruction
had been decided on long before, on account of their connexion with the Yorkist
dynasty<a id="FNanchor_526_526"/><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a>.
Cromwell’s activity in procuring matter for the various indictments is sufficiently
attested by an enormous number of notes of evidence and memoranda for prosecution
in the hand of his chief clerk. The apparent difficulty which he had in trumping
up any plausible charges against his victims, would seem to show that no adequate
proof of any really disloyal intent could be found. Indeed, in order to have any
sort of excuse for the arrests of the Marquis and Marchioness of Exeter, Cromwell
had to exhume a long forgotten episode, and accuse the latter of having ridden in
disguise three years before to confer with the Holy Maid; while it was remembered
that the Marquis had been put in the Tower in 1531 on the charge of assembling the
commons of Cornwall for an insurrection, with intent to depose the King. An
unfortunate remark of Courtenay’s that ‘Knavys rule about the Kyng,’ and that he
hoped ‘to gyue them a buffet oone day,’ was brought up against him as a treasonable
sentence; it certainly could not have been pleasing to Cromwell, who was doubtless
the arch-‘knave’ referred to<a id="FNanchor_527_527"/><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>.
But it is very unlikely that any of the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
noblemen had been guilty of crimes which could fairly be interpreted as treason.
The French ambassador had hit upon the real secret of their offences when he
remarked that they all were adherents of the White Rose<a id="FNanchor_528_528"/><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>.
In fact the whole plot against Pole may in one sense be regarded as preparatory to
a final attack on the Yorkist nobles, whose position had never been secure since
the accession of the House of Tudor. Blow after blow had been struck against them
by Henry VIII. and his father, but still some vestige of them seemed always to
remain, to threaten the King’s position and endanger his succession. There can be
no doubt that Cromwell, whose action in the case was certainly influenced more
than usual by personal animosity, found little difficulty in persuading the King
that the existence of Courtenay was a serious menace to the security of the reigning
dynasty, on account of the claim that he had to the throne as grandson of Edward
IV. At any rate, Henry seemed resolved on a wholesale destruction of all nobles
who could possibly be regarded as rivals of the Crown, and the relationship of
most of his victims to the family of the persecuted Cardinal afforded him a pretext
of which he did not fail to take advantage. Exeter, Montague, and Nevill were
beheaded in December, on Tower Hill, while Sir Geoffrey Pole, who had been tried
and condemned with them, was spared, mainly, as Cromwell frankly told Castillon at
the end of December, because the King expected to get something more out of
him<a id="FNanchor_529_529"/><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a>.
He was ultimately pardoned, but passed the rest of his life in musing, ‘going about,’
says a contemporary writer, ‘like one terror-stricken all his days<a id="FNanchor_530_530"/><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>.’</p>

<p>The Marchioness of Exeter and the Countess of Salisbury were meantime held
prisoners in the Tower. On May 12,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
1539, ‘the moste tractable parlament’ that Henry ever had passed a sweeping bill
of attainder, to legalize the wanton massacres of the preceding year and to destroy
the victims who still remained<a id="FNanchor_531_531"/><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>.
The Marchioness of Exeter was subsequently pardoned, but the Countess dragged on a
miserable existence in prison for more than two years after her attainder. The
only evidence of her treason was a cloth which had been found in her house,
embroidered on one side with the arms of England and on the other with the five
wounds of Christ, the emblem carried by the rebels in the Pilgrimage of Grace.
Still execution was delayed, and it was not until the spring of 1541, almost a
year after the death of Cromwell, that an insurrection in Yorkshire under Sir John
Nevill sealed her fate, and she was barbarously beheaded by a clumsy executioner
on May 28<a id="FNanchor_532_532"/><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>.</p>

<p>Meantime the Cardinal at Rome, powerless as he was to prevent the ruin of his
family, was contriving in some way to humble the arrogant King and the ruthless
minister who had caused him so much woe. The Pope saw that what Henry dreaded most
of all was a coalition of Francis and Charles, and as there was a good prospect of
this event at the close of 1538, he sent Pole to each of these two sovereigns to
urge them to agree to stop all trade with England and lay the foundation for a
continental league against her. Pole gladly accepted the task, and careless of his
own safety, though he knew that his path would be full of Henry’s hired assassins,
he set out for Spain and reached the Emperor’s Court at Toledo in safety in February,
1539. When the King heard of his arrival there, he wrote to Charles in very much
the same way that he had addressed Francis two years before, accusing Pole as a
traitor, and demanding his extradition as such, or at least insisting that Charles
should not grant him an audience<a id="FNanchor_533_533"/><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>.
But unfortunately Henry was now no longer in a position to dictate, and the
Emperor, realizing this, saw no reason to accede to his request, and answered, as
Cromwell later wrote to Wriothesley, that if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Pole ‘wer<i>e</i> his owne trayto<i>ur</i>, co<i>m</i>myng from that holy father’
he could not refuse him audience<a id="FNanchor_534_534"/><a href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>.
But in spite of all this, the Cardinal’s mission was a failure. Charles for the
present was content with the slight rebuke that he had given Henry for his bullying
ways; cautious as ever, he did not propose to put himself in a position from which
he could not retreat until he was sure of his ground, and intimated to the legate
that the Pope had made a great mistake in publishing censures which he could not
enforce. Pole could not obtain his consent to the Papal proposals and left Toledo
much discouraged<a id="FNanchor_535_535"/><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>.
He was also exceedingly suspicious of some design of Sir Thomas Wyatt’s to cause
his assassination, and mentioned it in a later letter to Cardinal Contarini<a id="FNanchor_536_536"/><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>.
That his fears were not entirely groundless is shown by a cipher letter from Wyatt
to Cromwell containing many passages pregnant with hidden meaning which can only
be explained if such a design is premised<a id="FNanchor_537_537"/><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>.
Pole soon betook himself to his friend Sadolet at Carpentras, whence he sent a
messenger to Francis on the same errand as that on which he himself had gone to
Charles. The French King’s reply was as unsatisfactory as the Emperor’s had been,
and in 1540 the Cardinal returned to Rome with his mission unaccomplished, and
deriving only small consolation from the thought that he had been successful in
baffling the attempts of Henry’s and Cromwell’s assassins.</p>

<p>The story of Pole’s life between 1535 and 1540 is the thread which binds
together the foreign and domestic, secular and religious history of Cromwell’s
administration. The Cardinal’s attempts to make the King renounce his title of
Supreme Head and the other insignia of the despotism to which Cromwell had raised
him at home were an absolute failure, and were punished with the shockingly unjust
and cruel destruction of his family. Still his efforts to thwart the main aim of
the foreign policy of the time, namely the separation of the interests of France
and Spain, though not directly successful, were instrumental in bringing about
the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[212]</a></span> fall of his arch-enemy
Cromwell. For the endeavours of the Cardinal were one of a number of things which
combined to persuade the minister that the catastrophe which seemed imminent
throughout the year 1539 could not be averted without external aid, and thus to
induce him to take a step on his own responsibility which soon led him into
disastrous conflict with the King.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE FOREIGN POLICY</p>

<p>During the ten years of Cromwell’s ministry, the relations of England with the
great continental powers presented a problem fully as difficult as that afforded
by the course of events at home. Cromwell’s efforts to cope with the dangers which
threatened England from without were far less successful than his internal
administration: in the latter he never failed to render invaluable service to the
Crown, while in the former he made the mistake which finally lost him the royal
favour and brought him to the block. As the results of the minister’s external
policy thus led directly to his fall, we may now return to the chronological order
of events, which was abandoned while the various phases of his home government
were under consideration.</p>

<p>Cromwell had entered the King’s service in 1530 with training and talents which
rendered him far more competent to undertake the domestic administration of the
country than to guide its foreign affairs. His acquaintance with different trades,
his legal ability, and his experience in the suppression of the smaller monasteries
for Wolsey’s purposes were of inestimable value to him throughout his ministry in
dealing with problems at home. But in the management of affairs abroad he was still
very inexperienced. He had borne no part in the great schemes of external policy
which had occupied the Cardinal, and though his speech in the Parliament of 1523
showed a very just appreciation of the situation of England abroad, he had had no
opportunity to put his ideas into practice. Thus at the outset we find him cautiously
remaining in the background and awaiting the development of the King’s foreign
policy. In this he was wise, for at Wolsey’s fall Henry had resolved to take the
external administration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span> of
England into his own hands. We have seen that the Cardinal’s failure had taught
him the danger of concluding any definite alliance with either France or Spain,
while the two great continental rivals remained at war. He had learned that
England’s best security lay in maintaining a position of neutrality between Charles
and Francis, and in balancing one against the other, while all disputes between
them were encouraged under cover of offers of mediation. It was along these lines
that Henry had determined to guide the foreign affairs of England, as soon as order
could be brought out of the chaos caused by the divorce. How correct his decision
was is proved by the utter collapse of the Imperial alliance of 1543, the only
really permanent departure from the policy of neutrality which Henry ever made
after the death of Wolsey. A complete change of the political horizon led him into
it, only to be left in the lurch by the Emperor at the peace of Crêpy<a id="FNanchor_538_538"/><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
in the same way that he had been abandoned before by Francis at the treaty of
Cambray. But during the life of Cromwell the King made no such blunder as this.
Though he sometimes wavered, he never definitely renounced the policy of neutrality,
although his minister, who sometimes doubted its efficacy, made several efforts to
induce him to abandon it. There can be no doubt that, from the very first, Cromwell
over-estimated the danger of a foreign invasion and failed to appreciate the real
strength of England’s isolated position: he was deceived by constant menaces which
never really bore fruit. A more intimate acquaintance with the practical and
calculating nature of Charles V. would certainly have convinced the King’s minister
that however much the Emperor threatened, he would never actually embark on the
somewhat remote project of a crusade against England, until a great many affairs
in his own scattered dominions on the Continent had first been settled to his
satisfaction. But Cromwell’s inexperience in the management of foreign affairs
blinded him to this important fact: and his over-eagerness to seek means for
England’s defence proved his ultimate ruin. After successfully co-operating with
Henry for seven years on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the basis of maintaining strict neutrality between France and Spain, and of
encouraging all disputes between them, he abandoned the wise policy of his master
in favour of an alliance in Germany which, in one form or another, had been under
consideration on several occasions before, but which had been abandoned every time
as unnecessary. This new alliance turned out disastrously. At the moment of its
completion, the situation on the Continent which had called it into existence
suddenly changed; it was thrown over, together with the minister who had originated
it. Such is the outline of the history of England’s foreign affairs from 1530 till
Cromwell’s fall. We can now take up the very complicated story in detail.</p>

<p>Although Henry ardently desired at once to put in practice the policy of neutrality
which he had learned from Wolsey’s failure, the affair of the divorce had thrown everything
into such confusion that an immediate application of the new principle was impossible.
In fact it was not until the beginning of the year 1536 that the King was able to
assume the position he desired in his relations with France and Spain. The alliance
with France which Wolsey had bequeathed to Henry was so close that the King saw that
he must at least partially withdraw from it, before he could hope to come to such
terms with the Emperor as would enable him to act the part of a neutral and benevolent
mediator between the foreign powers. But at this juncture the King’s anxiety to obtain
a legal justification for his second marriage was paramount in his mind. In fact it
almost seems to have blinded him temporarily to the policy that he doubtless intended
ultimately to pursue. His energies were all bent towards securing the aid of
Francis in his ‘grete matier’; and for the moment he postponed his policy of
conciliating the Emperor, who was of course at that time in league with the Pope.
Each pair of allies had interviews and counter-interviews, but with very different
results. While Henry and Francis were at first most cordial, Clement counted
Charles’ proffered friendship as of slight weight, against the prospect of losing
the support of the two most powerful kings of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
Christendom, and of being forced to submit to the summoning of the General Council
by which the Emperor proposed to rectify the abuses which had crept into the Holy
Church<a id="FNanchor_539_539"/><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>.
The visit at Bologna of Francis’ ambassadors, Cardinals Tournon and Grammont,
undid all that Charles’ threats had accomplished<a id="FNanchor_540_540"/><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>,
and Clement, although he feebly menaced Henry with excommunication in case he
proceeded with his second marriage<a id="FNanchor_541_541"/><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>,
refused to accede to the Emperor’s wishes that he should take more active measures
against England. Meantime Henry had endeavoured to come to an understanding with
the See of Rome concerning the hearing of his case before a Council, in the hope
that by giving the Pope fair words, he might still obtain a favourable decision<a id="FNanchor_542_542"/><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a>.
The King’s confidence in the ultimate success of his efforts was so high at the
opening of the year 1533, that he dared to give it expression by increasingly
harsh treatment of Katherine. She was moved further away from the Court than ever
before, and hardly a day passed without seeing her subjected to some new indignity.
Every effort which her friends made on her behalf seemed unavailing. As petitions
to Henry himself were unanswered, Chapuys in despair turned to Cromwell, whom he
had by this time recognized as the man who managed all the King’s affairs<a id="FNanchor_543_543"/><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>.
But Cromwell succeeded in evading the demands of the Imperial ambassador also; in
fact he displayed such ability in ‘beknaving’ Chapuys that Henry always employed
him in future to answer the perfectly justifiable complaints of the Spanish representative.
Cromwell delayed the interview which the ambassador had requested until he had had
time to consult with the King<a id="FNanchor_544_544"/><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a>:
and when he finally met Chapuys, he spent much time in applauding all the efforts
that had been made to maintain friendly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
relations between Spain and England. But when urged to do his best to protect the
Queen and Princess from the ignominies to which they were subjected, Cromwell’s
replies were evasive, if not absolutely untruthful. Chapuys was so exasperated at
the cool way in which his claims to justice had been set aside, that he took
occasion to hint that Charles and Francis might some day join forces against
England, to ‘which Cromwell assented, but showed no great joy thereat.’ The threat,
however, had no lasting effect. The treatment of the Queen went on from bad to
worse, and two months later the same conversation took place all over again, with
the same unsatisfactory result<a id="FNanchor_545_545"/><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>.
As long as Cromwell consented to obey his master’s commands implicitly, and to
devote himself solely to finding means to carry out the plans which the King’s
riper experience told him were feasible, without trying to take the lead himself,
the two were an almost invincible combination.</p>

<p>But the time was soon to come when Chapuys’ prophecy of a coalition of France
and Spain seemed more likely to be fulfilled. Henry’s impatience to conclude his
matrimonial troubles finally led him to throw caution to the winds. He had, as we
have already seen, postponed the application of his wise policy of neutrality in
the hope of obtaining aid from France. But the French King did not move quickly
enough to suit him, and in the summer of 1533 he committed such a breach of diplomatic
courtesy that he completely alienated his ‘nere and dere brother.’ He had overtaxed
his friendship with the King of France by requiring him to support every move he
made, and to threaten the Pope, if his Holiness refused to do the same. Francis
only partially acceded to Henry’s wishes. Meantime all hope of obtaining the divorce
from Rome had been abandoned owing to Cromwell’s advice; the affair was tried in
England, and Anne Boleyn was publicly proclaimed Queen. A provisional sentence of
excommunication was passed on Henry in July, giving him till September to decide
whether he would take Katherine back or not. A few months before, Francis and Henry
had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> together endeavoured to
win over the Pope against the Emperor: now that the bull of excommunication had
come, Francis continued his good offices by offering to mediate for Henry with the
Holy See. Henry, however, blusteringly assured him that he was not in need of any
mediation—he hoped that Francis would not trouble himself<a id="FNanchor_546_546"/><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>.
But the latter would not take the hint that England’s policy towards the See of
Rome had changed from conciliation to open hostility, and invited Clement to meet
him at Marseilles, to see if he could not bring about an agreement. The Pope, who
needed Francis’ aid in the furtherance of his own plans for the prevention of the
dreaded Council, readily accepted the opportunity which had been offered<a id="FNanchor_547_547"/><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>.
Henry was of course unable to prevent an interview between the two potentates, but
he attempted to throw cold water on the whole affair by sending an embassy to
Clement while the latter was the guest of the King of France, to announce to his
Holiness that he intended to appeal against his sentence to the very General Council
which the Pope was attempting to forestall. The chief result of this extraordinary
proceeding was simply to deprive the King of the only ally that he had. Francis
was naturally exceedingly angry, and flatly refused to fight Henry’s battles for
him any more<a id="FNanchor_548_548"/><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>.
Such was the reward reaped from the alliance which Wolsey six years before had
been at such pains to bring about, in the hope of obtaining much-needed support in
the matter of the divorce<a id="FNanchor_549_549"/><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>!</p>

<p>So far it certainly seemed as if Henry’s foreign policy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
instead of gaining him his desired position as neutral and pretended mediator
between France and Spain, had only served to alienate both. As his cruel treatment
of Katherine and Mary had not improved his position with Charles, he had to cast
about for other allies to counterbalance the effect of his tiff with Francis. It
is at this juncture that Cromwell first steps into prominence in connexion with
foreign affairs. There can be little doubt that the negotiations with the Lutheran
princes, which began in July, 1533, were planned by him. It is of course natural
to look to the man, whose name six years later became inseparably associated with
a German alliance, as the originator of the scheme; in addition to this there is
documentary evidence. A letter which Chapuys wrote to the Emperor, July 30, 1533,
informs us that two of Cromwell’s men (one of whom later turned out to be his
trusty Stephen Vaughan) had been sent to Germany presumably ‘to embroil’ all they
could<a id="FNanchor_550_550"/><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>;
and on August 3, a letter reporting the progress of the ambassadors was written by
them to Cromwell from Antwerp<a id="FNanchor_551_551"/><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>.
Vaughan and his companion, a certain Christopher Mont, arrived in Nürnberg on the
22nd, whence they sent home minute accounts of the state of religion in Germany;
the one observing, with apparent regret, that the country was not nearly as disturbed
as had been thought, while the other assured Cromwell that he had never seen a
land whose towns were so much divided<a id="FNanchor_552_552"/><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a>.
Some time in the autumn Cromwell sent a reply to Mont, praising his diligence, and
urging him above all things to discover the state of feeling in Germany towards
the King of England and the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_553_553"/><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>.
The envoy appears to have returned from his preliminary tour of investigation
before the close of the year, for in January, 1534, he was sent back again to
Germany, this time accompanied by Nicholas Heath, with instructions to convey to
the Lutheran princes the sympathy of the King of England, as being also an enemy
of the Pope, and to express his willingness to unite with them for the extirpation
of false doctrines<a id="FNanchor_554_554"/><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>.
England’s overtures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> however,
were not received with as much enthusiasm as Henry perhaps had expected, and
nothing definite resulted from the mission of Heath and Mont for a long time. The
Germans probably had serious misgivings about the genuineness of Henry’s Protestantism,
and their suspicions of his sincerity were confirmed by a new development of
England’s foreign policy in the same year.</p>

<p>As one of the consequences of an unwarrantable act of piracy near the English
coast in the autumn of 1533, Henry had been able to get hold of a prominent young
man of the violently Protestant town of Lübeck, by name Mark Meyer. At London he
was treated with the greatest courtesy by the King and Cromwell, and returned to
his native city invested with the honour of knighthood<a id="FNanchor_555_555"/><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>.
Such bounty was seldom showered on anybody by Henry VIII. without some ulterior
purpose, and Meyer’s case was no exception to the general rule. It soon transpired
that proposals had been made for a close alliance between England and Lübeck<a id="FNanchor_556_556"/><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>.
Ever since the peace of Stralsund in 1370, the cities of the Hanseatic League had
claimed a decisive voice in the affairs of the neighbouring realm of Denmark<a id="FNanchor_557_557"/><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>:
the death of the king of that country in April, 1533, had left the throne vacant,
and Lübeck was at this moment bent on obtaining the disposal of it. Henry signified
his willingness to aid the Lübeckers in this enterprise, on condition that they
would promise that if they were successful they would be guided by him in the
final bestowal of the Danish crown. In May, 1534, the Lübeckers sent an embassy to
England<a id="FNanchor_558_558"/><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a>,
and the proposals of the previous year were accepted.</p>

<p>The new alliance had a very important bearing on the larger issues of Henry’s
foreign policy. The social and political revolution which had been in progress in
Lübeck since 1530 had placed the power in the hands of a party whose anti-papal tendencies
were fully as violent as those of the Wittenberg theologians, and whose conscientious
scruples were of less weight, when thrown into the scales of political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
expediency<a id="FNanchor_559_559"/><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a>.
The treaty concluded with England contained certain doctrinal statements which lay
suspiciously close to the needs of Henry’s immediate position<a id="FNanchor_560_560"/><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>,
and the King must have been at least temporarily convinced that he had obtained a
valuable ally against the See of Rome. The treaty with Lübeck was also a very
distinct move against the Emperor, for an Imperial candidate had been proposed for
the vacant throne of Denmark, and by supporting the Lübeckers Henry necessarily
opposed Charles. But the new alliance failed to accomplish what was expected of
it: in fact it actually worked to England’s disadvantage. Before its conclusion,
George Wullenwever, the demagogue whom the recent upheaval had rendered temporarily
supreme in Lübeck, had offered to support the claims of the Lutheran Duke of Holstein
to the Danish throne; but when Holstein, unwilling to gain his ends by force,
prudently refused the proffered aid, the friendship of the Lübeckers was converted
into bitter enmity. They soon invaded his lands, but were repulsed and besieged in
turn in their own city: a peace of a most extraordinary nature finally resulted,
by which an agreement was reached in regard to the affairs of Holstein, though both
parties reserved the right of continuing the war for the disposal of the crown of
Denmark. That country in the meantime, seeing that its sole chance of safety lay
in obtaining a strong and capable leader, elected the Duke of Holstein to the vacant
throne, under the title of Christian III.—a severe blow to the pretensions of the
Lübeckers, who were now robbed of their best excuse for interference in Danish
affairs, namely their professed desire to introduce pure religion there<a id="FNanchor_561_561"/><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>.
Lübeck, however, had now gone too far to draw back, and prepared to attack the new
King in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span> connexion with
England. Henry must have been much annoyed at the complication into which his new
alliance had led him—it seemed doubly foolish, in view of his attempts to conciliate
the German Protestants, that he should get himself entangled with the enemies of
those whom he wished to make his friends. But though the King was advised by Dr.
Barnes, the English ambassador at Hamburg, to drop Lübeck and conciliate
Christian<a id="FNanchor_562_562"/><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a>,
he was as usual too proud to acknowledge that he had made a mistake. He soon
reaped the reward of his obstinacy, as the Lübeckers, in their new attempt to
overthrow Christian, were again completely defeated. Henry had aided them with the
services of two skilled engineers, and the Danish King sent an embassy to demand
an explanation of his conduct<a id="FNanchor_563_563"/><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>.
Christian’s envoy was treated with scant courtesy by the King and Cromwell, the
latter vainly attempting to conceal his master’s anxiety by several preposterous
lies<a id="FNanchor_564_564"/><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a>.
But still the King was unwilling to consent to a complete reversal of his Lübeck
policy, and finally sent the ambassador home with an answer which Chapuys characterizes
as ‘obscure and ambiguous.’ Several subsequent victories of Christian, in which
certain English ships which had been sent to aid the Lübeckers were captured, were
sufficient however to convince Henry that he had unduly despised the power of the
new Danish King; and though his relations with Lübeck continued to be friendly, he
carefully abstained from any further active measures on her behalf. But he had
already done enough at least temporarily to alienate his Lutheran friends, who
were shocked at the way in which the King of England attached himself to people
whose religious principles were as extreme as those of the Lübeckers, and who had
dared to attack one of their own number.</p>

<p>Thus each of the two alliances with which Henry had sought to fortify himself
against France and Spain had rendered the other worthless. The King probably bitterly
regretted that his matrimonial difficulties had led him to stray so far from the
policy which he originally intended to pursue.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Had he been able to secure his desired position as neutral and pretended mediator
between France and Spain, he could have relied on this eminently advantageous
situation alone to secure safety for England abroad, without troubling himself
about any outside alliance. But to attain this position was impossible, as we have
seen, until he became reconciled to Charles, and reconciliation with Charles was
out of the question as long as Katherine remained subjected to such indignity.
Here lay the key to the whole situation. The treatment of the divorced Queen was
the sole hindrance to a cordial relation between Spain and England, and consequently
to the final application of the policy which Henry so ardently desired. But there
could be no hope of an alleviation of her sufferings, for the King and Cromwell
were by this time irrevocably committed to a brutal attitude towards Katherine and
her daughter by the course of events since the first trial of the divorce. The
inference was obvious. As long as Katherine lived, a reconciliation with Charles,
with all its attendant benefits, was impossible: her death alone could pave the
way for it. That these thoughts had already taken shape at least in Cromwell’s
mind is proved by a hint which the King’s minister dropped in Chapuys’ presence in
August, 1534, to the effect that the death of the Queen and Princess would remove
all occasion for a quarrel between their masters<a id="FNanchor_565_565"/><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>.</p>

<p>But the autumn of 1534 saw several events which served to encourage the King and
his minister, and seemed temporarily to postpone the necessity of coming to terms
with the Emperor. The first of these events was the death of the Pope in September,
an occurrence which, according to Chapuys, caused Henry and Cromwell such joy that
the latter was ‘unable to refrain from saying several times in public that this great
devil was dead, and it seemed as if he was very sorry that he could find no worse
name for him than devil<a id="FNanchor_566_566"/><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>.’
Francis moreover, solely on account of his very strained relations with Charles,
had slowly begun to recover from the effects of Henry’s discourtesy at Marseilles,
and had made fresh efforts to come to terms with England again;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
while Henry, unwilling as yet to proceed to extremities in order to gain the
friendship of Charles, welcomed the prospect of a renewal of amity with France.
But the satisfaction which the King derived from the attitude of Francis was rudely
dispelled in a few months. Several interviews which had been arranged between the
two sovereigns had failed, for various reasons, to take place, but the Emperor
meantime had not been idle. Imbued with the idea of vindicating the rights of the
Princess Mary by some decisive stroke, he had actually sent the Count of Nassau to
the French Court to suggest that Francis should ask Henry to give her to the Duke
of Angoulême<a id="FNanchor_567_567"/><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>.
Francis considered the Emperor’s plan worth a trial, and in October sent over an
embassy under Admiral de Brion to propose it to the King of England. Henry had
little idea of the unpleasant surprise that was in store for him, and made great
preparations for the reception of the Frenchmen, and Cromwell sent for a number of
beautiful young ladies to come to the Court to entertain them<a id="FNanchor_568_568"/><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a>.
There seems to be some doubt whether de Brion first proposed that Mary should be
given to the Duke of Angoulême or to the Dauphin<a id="FNanchor_569_569"/><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>,
but both suggestions were equally disagreeable to Henry. An acceptance of either
proposal would of course involve retracting his declaration that Mary was illegitimate,
and annulling his hard-earned invalidation of his first marriage, and yet he dared
not insult Francis a second time. His first reply, according to Chapuys, was that
he would agree to give Mary to Angoulême if both would make a solemn renunciation
of all claims that they could bring forward to the English throne<a id="FNanchor_570_570"/><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>.
But the Spanish ambassador seemed to think that this proposal would not prove
satisfactory, and we gather from the official report of Henry’s answer that the
suggestion was dropped. Instead, however, the King finally replied that if Francis
could obtain from the new Pope a decision that the sentence of Clement was void,
he might be induced to renounce his claim to the French throne in exchange for certain
lands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> and titles in the Netherlands,
and further hinted that it might be possible to arrange a match between Elizabeth
and the Duke of Angoulême<a id="FNanchor_571_571"/><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>.
But this proposal amounted to little more than a diplomatic refusal of Francis’
request. De Brion went away disappointed, and forgetting his usual caution, and
the fact that England was still in a stronger position than France, determined to
avenge himself for the failure of his mission by parading before the eyes of
Cromwell and his master the probability of the dreaded alliance of France and
Spain, in much the same way that Chapuys had done in the previous year. When
Cromwell appeared in the great hall to make the farewell present, the Admiral
disengaged himself from the crowd, and came to the Imperial ambassador with the
greatest civility, expressing his regret at not having seen the Princess Mary,
‘the principal gem of the kingdom,’ and finally declaring that if he and Chapuys
could only bring their masters to accord, all would go well<a id="FNanchor_572_572"/><a href="#Footnote_572_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a>.</p>

<p>In spite of Cromwell’s boasting, we may well believe that de Brion had succeeded
in making Henry feel very uncomfortable. The inferences which the King must have drawn
from the conduct of the ambassador at his departure were further confirmed by the
ominous silence from France which followed the Admiral’s return. But Francis himself
was in too precarious a position to afford to throw away any chances, so after a
couple of months’ delay, he pocketed his pride and sent over another embassy under
Palamedes Gontier, Treasurer of Brittany, to continue negotiations on the basis of
a marriage between Elizabeth and the Duke of Angoulême. Henry was all the more annoyed
that Francis should take him at his word, and entertain seriously the somewhat chimerical
proposal with which he had dismissed de Brion; and the mission of Gontier failed as
signally as its predecessor had done, in coming to any definite conclusion<a id="FNanchor_573_573"/><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>.
But Henry had chosen a very poor moment to administer this final rebuff; for the Emperor
had departed on an expedition against Tunis, and thus left Francis a comparatively
free hand on the Continent. The advantage of position had hitherto lain with
England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span> but the absence of
Charles totally altered the aspect of affairs. The French King felt himself once more
master of the situation, and was not slow to inform Henry that he did not propose to
be dallied with any longer. The reconquest of Milan was at this moment his heart’s
desire; to accomplish it he needed English aid. So he commissioned the Bailly of Troyes
to convey to Henry a Papal brief which had been sent to the French Court, and which
required all Christian princes to cease to hold intercourse with the heretical King
of England; he further instructed his ambassador to make it clear that the sole consideration
which would induce the King of France to disregard the brief, would be a liberal contribution
of English gold, whenever he saw fit to make war on the Emperor. This announcement,
which was practically an ultimatum, took Henry completely by surprise: angry words
passed between him and the French envoy, but there was no use disguising the fact
that Francis had the upper hand<a id="FNanchor_574_574"/><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a>.
The King finally sent Gardiner to Paris to answer the French claims; the instructions
which the ambassador received reveal a much more conciliatory attitude than Henry
had yet adopted towards France<a id="FNanchor_575_575"/><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a>.
The gravity of the situation was further confirmed by the seizure and detention at
Bordeaux of several English ships, for the recovery of which Cromwell kept writing
urgent letters to the Bishop of Winchester<a id="FNanchor_576_576"/><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>.
It was at this juncture that the King and his minister made a feeble effort to
reap some reward from the mission of Heath and Mont to the Lutherans in the
preceding year. Attempts were made to bring the reformer Melancthon to England, or
at least to prevent his going to Francis, who had sent for him in order to obtain
the support of his followers against Charles<a id="FNanchor_577_577"/><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a>.
The latter effort was superfluous; the former failed. Melancthon had no intention
of going to France, but the King and Cromwell could not persuade him to come to
England either. Henry’s agent, Dr. Barnes, however, informed the Lutherans that
the King would not refuse to join in an alliance with them for the defence of the
Gospel, provided they would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
support him against the Pope, and he promised them that another ambassador, the
Bishop of Hereford, would come and talk further with them<a id="FNanchor_578_578"/><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>.
At the close of the year the envoy was received in Germany. Long negotiations
followed, at first with some hope of success. A request by the English ambassador
that the Germans would unite with his master in a refusal to recognize a General
Council convoked by the Pope, was favourably received; and the plenipotentiaries
of the Lutherans drew up a response in which they expressed themselves as entirely
in accord with Henry in regard to the See of Rome, and offered the King of England
the proud title of Defender and Protector of their league. As long as the Bishop
of Hereford restricted himself to theological discussion and abuse of the Pope all
went well, but when he made the more practical demand for aid to his master in
money and ships in case of an invasion, the Germans drew back: they were not
prepared to go as far as this until a more complete agreement had been reached in
matters of religion. Trouble arose also over the question of the King’s divorce:
the Lutherans acknowledged that marriage with a brother’s widow was wrong, but
they refused to admit, if such a union had taken place, that it was right to break
it<a id="FNanchor_579_579"/><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>.
The news of the executions of More and Fisher, moreover, had caused great
consternation in Germany, where every effort was being made to introduce the new
doctrines without bloodshed; and the Bishop of Hereford was finally sent away
empty-handed, the negotiations having resulted in a failure which plainly foreshadowed
the events of 1538 and 1539. Taken as a whole, the year 1535 had simply been
occupied in playing over again the game of 1534. Twice had the French alliance
been tested, and it had failed. Twice had Henry and Cromwell sought security in a
league with the Lutherans—without success. Two proofs had been afforded that a
reconciliation with Charles was the surest road to England’s safety; and this time
the alternative of a closer alliance with France, which, in 1534, had offered the
King and his minister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span> a
temporary escape from an ultimately inevitable conclusion, was out of the question.
But a reconciliation with the Emperor, as we have already seen, was impossible
during the lifetime of Katherine.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances then, we can scarcely wonder that the Imperial
ambassador reported to his master that the death of the Queen, which occurred on
January 7, 1536, was due to foul play<a id="FNanchor_580_580"/><a href="#Footnote_580_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a>.
Chapuys also possessed other evidence, which tended to strengthen him in this
conclusion. He had not forgotten the sinister hint which Cromwell had let fall in
his presence in August, 1534; and he had apparently discovered that in November,
1535, the King had plainly told his most trusted counsellors that he must be rid
of the Queen and Princess at the next Parliament<a id="FNanchor_581_581"/><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>.
Nor did Henry’s unseemly conduct when he received the news of the death of his
first wife escape the notice of the Imperial ambassador. Chapuys wrote to Charles
how the King clothed himself in yellow from head to foot, and spent the day in
mirth and revelry. ‘God be praised,’ had Henry exclaimed, ‘that we are free from
all suspicion of war<a id="FNanchor_582_582"/><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>.’
The ambassador also dwelt at length on the suspicious secrecy and almost indecent
haste with which the body of the Queen was opened, embalmed, and enclosed in lead;
on the very significant testimony extracted from the chandler of the house who did
the work, and on the statements of the doctor and of the Queen’s confessor. The
verdict of the best modern medical authorities on the post-mortem examination as
reported by the chandler strongly favours the conclusion that Katherine was not
poisoned<a id="FNanchor_583_583"/><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>,
but died of a disease called melanotic sarcoma, or, more popularly, cancer of the
heart: the testimony of a sixteenth-century artisan, however, is but a poor basis
for a modern scientific investigation. If the Queen was murdered, there is every
reason to think that Cromwell was chiefly responsible for the crime. To a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
of his character and training such a step would have been far less repugnant than
to Henry, had he once assured himself that it was indispensable to his purposes.
He had had sufficient experience of the Italy of Alexander VI. and Caesar Borgia
to render him quite callous to the ordinary sentiments of humanity in such matters.
He had never fully realized the innate strength of England’s isolated position; he
was always alarmed by the danger of foreign invasion far more than his master, and
consequently was more ready to adopt desperate measures to avert it. It does not
seem likely that the more experienced Henry would have originated the plan of
murdering his wife, until the crisis in foreign affairs had become far more acute.
Though he fully comprehended the many advantages of a closer alliance with Charles,
he must have been reasonably certain that he had little cause to fear a direct
attack in the immediate future, especially as the death of the Duke of Milan in
the end of October had opened glorious possibilities for a renewal of the quarrel
between Francis and Charles. Of course it is mere folly to suppose that Cromwell
would have attempted to murder the Queen without the King’s full consent. It is
more than probable however that—if poison it was—it was he who put the idea into
Henry’s mind, and took the responsibility for its execution upon himself.</p>

<p>In any event the death of Katherine, whether due to natural causes or ‘advancé
sinistrement’ as Chapuys expressed it, was the means by which Henry was at last
enabled to attain the position in foreign affairs that he had aimed at since the
fall of Wolsey, and to put in practice a policy which, combined with a fortunate
turn of events abroad, was destined, for two years, to lead to the most glorious
results. It removed the chief cause of jealousy between England and the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_584_584"/><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a>,
and enabled Henry to point out to Francis, who as we have seen had of late been
taking a very haughty tone with him, that the situation of the two countries had
again been reversed, and that France was no longer in a position to dictate. This
task Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> performed for
him three days after the Queen’s death, with his usual directness and efficiency.
The King’s minister wrote to Gardiner and Wallop on January 8, indicating that the
death of Katherine had removed ‘the onelie matier of the vnkyndenes’ between his
master and the Emperor, and instructing the ambassadors in their ‘conferenc<i>es</i>
and procedyng<i>es</i> w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the frensh kyng and his counsaile’ to
keep themselves ‘the more aloof and be the more Froyt and colde in relentyng to
any their ou<i>er</i>tur<i>es</i> or request<i>es</i><a id="FNanchor_585_585"/><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a>.’
A comparison of this letter with one which Cromwell had written to the Bishop of
Winchester two months earlier<a id="FNanchor_586_586"/><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
reveals a very striking change of tone, which nothing else than the death of
Katherine could have rendered possible.</p>

<p>The King’s secretary was no less prompt in pointing out to the Imperial ambassador
the bearing of the decease of the divorced Queen on England’s relations with Spain.
He was not ashamed to remark to one of Chapuys’ men that the Emperor had the greatest
cause to be thankful for the death of Katherine, which in his judgement was the very
best thing that could have happened for the preservation of the amity between Henry
and Charles, as it completely removed the sole cause of jealousy between them<a id="FNanchor_587_587"/><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a>.
The Emperor was too hard-headed a politician not to see the force of Cromwell’s words.
We cannot doubt that he was exceedingly angry at the death of his aunt, which he certainly
believed was due to foul play; but his situation was such that revenge was impossible,
and with characteristic calmness and self-control he determined to conceal his resentment
and conciliate Henry. It was doubtless with his full sanction that Chapuys welcomed
all Cromwell’s proposals, which looked towards a more cordial relation between England
and Spain. Meantime Francis had not been slow to take the hint which Gardiner, at Cromwell’s
command, had given him, and was again using every effort to regain Henry’s favour.
The breach between the two continental sovereigns was, to the King’s intense joy,
becoming wider every day, with the result that each was making frantic attempts to
outbid the other for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> England’s
friendship. Henry’s position was for the moment almost ideal. All he needed to do
was to keep the two rivals just evenly balanced. But precisely at this critical
juncture, Cromwell for the first time in his ministry made a move without the King’s
leave, which, had it not been instantly forestalled, would have completely upset
the beautiful equilibrium which Henry had laboured so hard to establish. The King
had doubtless ordered him to be cordial to Chapuys, in order to counterbalance the
effects of the warmth of Francis; but he had not the least idea of entering into
any definite agreement, which might lose him his precious position of neutrality.
But Cromwell did not see this. He exceeded his instructions, was voluble in his
disparagement of the French in Chapuys’ presence, and finally brought matters to
such a point that he went with Chapuys to the King to propose an Imperial alliance<a id="FNanchor_588_588"/><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>.
It was the most open avowal he had yet made of a leaning towards Spain, that he
had doubtless cherished for a long time. Born among the common people, Cromwell’s
early life had been spent in that atmosphere of bitter hatred of France, which for
generations had been one of the most predominant characteristics of the lower
classes in England. In the first half of the sixteenth century, hatred of France
meant friendship with Spain, and from the first years of the reign of Henry VIII.
one encounters at every turn evidences of the devotion of the common people to the
Imperial cause. Wolsey’s policy of peace with France had won him almost as many
enemies among the lower classes as his reputation as originator of oppressive
financial measures. Cromwell had determined not to make the same mistake that his
predecessor had, but he was foolish enough to err on the opposite side. During the
year 1535 he had given hints that he was no friend of France<a id="FNanchor_589_589"/><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a>.
His rudeness to the French ambassadors on more than one occasion had convinced
Chapuys that he favoured the Emperor, but as yet he had not gone far enough to
bring himself into collision with the King. But this time he had forgotten his
previous caution, and his rashness resulted in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
his first serious quarrel with his master. Henry may well have been furious that
his minister’s recklessness had threatened to destroy the whole fabric of a policy
which he had been at such pains to put in operation. The Imperial ambassador gives
us an amusing account of a scene which ensued in the Privy Chamber when he came
with Cromwell to propose an alliance between England and Spain. After Chapuys had
propounded the terms of a possible treaty, Henry called Cromwell and Audeley to
him and retired to another part of the room. ‘They talked together,’ writes Chapuys,
who kept a vigilant eye upon the gestures of the King and those with him. ‘There
seemed to be some dispute and considerable anger, as I thought, between the King
and Cromwell; and after a considerable time Cromwell grumbling left the conference
in the window where the King was, excusing himself that he was so very thirsty
that he was quite exhausted, as he really was with pure vexation, and sat down
upon a coffer out of sight of the King, where he sent for something to drink.’
Henry soon came to Chapuys, and after being as rude as possible, reproaching the
Emperor with past ingratitude, and asserting that Milan rightfully belonged to the
French, waived the point at issue entirely, and was with difficulty persuaded to
look over the treaties at a later time. ‘At this slender and provoking answer,’
writes Chapuys, ‘I left the Court, and went to wait on Cromwell,’ whose regret was
so great ‘that he was hardly able to speak for sorrow, and had never been more
mortified in his life, than with the said reply<a id="FNanchor_590_590"/><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>.’</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></p>

<p>Ample justification was soon afforded for Henry’s strict adherence to the policy
of neutrality, for events on the Continent had moved rapidly forward, and Charles
and Francis were at last at open war. By restraining Cromwell from making the
mistake of cementing an alliance with the Emperor, and by guarding himself against
a too close intimacy with Francis, the King had succeeded in placing England in
such a position that the two great continental powers were forced to grovel at her
feet. From the beginning of 1536 until the autumn of 1537, when the truce between
France and Flanders (forerunner of the peace of Nice in the summer of 1538) was
concluded, the history of the foreign policy of England is as simple as it is
glorious and triumphant. Henry, constantly pretending to be desirous of arbitrating
between France and Spain, ‘for the peax and weale of Christendome,’ as he elegantly
put it, was in reality solely occupied with the endeavour to embroil them the more.
Alternately encouraging and repelling advances from both sovereigns, by judiciously
proposing and then retreating from alliances with each of them, he succeeded
admirably in keeping Charles and Francis in a constant state of anxiety, as regarded
his true position. Cromwell’s letters tell the story of the time very clearly. ‘An
answer soo general that it doth neither refuse their alliance, ne moche encorage
them, to co<i>n</i>ceyue that they maye w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>out difficultie obteyn
their desire’ was the reply which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
English ambassadors were ordered to give at the French and Spanish Courts<a id="FNanchor_591_591"/><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>.
So secure did Henry feel himself abroad that he dared to issue a manifesto in
contempt of the General Council<a id="FNanchor_592_592"/><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>,
which the Pope had summoned to meet at Mantua, and to publish the Ten Articles of
1536, which, while primarily intended to serve another purpose, were politically
useful as a formal refusal to respect it. It was very fortunate for England that
her affairs abroad were so prosperous at this juncture, as the end of 1536 and
the beginning of 1537 were full of anxiety at home, owing to the outbreak of the
rebellion in the North.</p>

<p>This happy state of affairs however was not destined to endure, for Francis and
Charles soon tired of their strife, and in the autumn of 1537 there were signs of
a reconciliation. Francis, moreover, had strengthened his position by a league with
the Turk, and began to feel powerful enough to make a move without Henry’s leave.
The first intimation of this unpleasant fact came to Henry in the shape of a refusal
of a matrimonial offer. The death of Queen Jane had left him free to marry again,
and so gave him an excellent opportunity once more to mix in continental affairs,
which he did not permit to escape him. Cromwell wrote a letter for him to Lord William
Howard and Gardiner, artfully instructing them to feel the way for a possible alliance
with Mme. de Longueville, who had just been affianced to James of Scotland. It was
too much of a favour to ask Francis to put aside the claims of a sovereign who had
always been his true friend, to make way for those of the more powerful but perfidious
King of England, and Henry’s offers were, after some negotiations, politely but
firmly declined, to the latter’s intense chagrin<a id="FNanchor_593_593"/><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>.
An almost equally ominous note of warning came from Spain at the same time. Sir
John Dudley, ambassador to announce the death of the Queen at the Spanish Court,
had expressed to the Emperor the King’s sorrow that his repeated offers of mediation
with France had been set aside, whereupon Charles turned on him, and informed him
that negotiations with France were already set on foot, though he relieved Henry’s
anxiety a little by assuring him that no actual treaty should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
be made without the King of England’s being included as a ‘premier contrahent,’ a
promise which Cromwell was continually harping upon a year later, when the situation
had entirely changed<a id="FNanchor_594_594"/><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus the year 1538 opened rather darkly for England. The dread with which Henry
watched the increasing signs of good-feeling between Charles and Francis led him
into ridiculous and undignified action. As soon as it was settled that Mary of
Guise was to become James’ wife, Henry literally scoured the continent of Europe
in search of an alliance for himself or his daughters, which would strengthen his
position and avert the impending crisis. A somewhat confusing set of double
instructions from Cromwell to his friend Philip Hoby, instructing him to negotiate
for possible marriages with the younger sister of James’ wife, with the daughter
of the Duke of Lorraine, and also with the Duchess of Milan, and to obtain their
portraits, is not without interest as revealing Henry’s state of mind<a id="FNanchor_595_595"/><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>.
The first two of these unions, if accomplished, would of course have rendered him
safe from France; the other would have put him on friendly terms with Spain; but
none of them was destined to succeed. The King even went so far as to permit Sir
Francis Brian, his agent at the French Court, to suggest that various suitable
ladies should be brought to Calais for his inspection, that he might be sure that
he made no mistake. Henry’s proceedings evoked such ridicule and derision in
continental Europe, that Castillon, the French ambassador, contrived to convey to
him the general feeling with such directness and force that he actually drew a
blush from the King himself<a id="FNanchor_596_596"/><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a>.
Finding that his endeavours to obtain a suitable wife for himself were abortive,
Henry looked about for an advantageous marriage for his daughter Mary. By alternately
holding out to the Emperor a prospect of a match for her with the Infant of Portugal,
and pretending to accept a proposition of the French representative, Castillon,
that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> should marry the
Duke of Orleans, he contrived to lay the basis for a continental quarrel. But his
success in this scheme was very short-lived. The only person that he could deceive
at all was Castillon. It seems that Cromwell, who again at this crisis took the
opportunity to show his decided leaning towards Spain, had openly disapproved of
the proposed French alliance, and when Castillon complained of this, Henry turned
fiercely upon his minister and reprimanded him, saying that he was a good manager,
but not fit to intermeddle in the affairs of kings, and finally Norfolk was sent
for. Cromwell’s ‘great Spanish passion,’ as Castillon called it, had got him into
trouble again, and the French ambassador was delighted, thinking that he had at
last obtained the upper hand. But Castillon’s delusions were rudely dispelled three
weeks later, when he learned that the King and Council were resolved ‘to withdraw
from the French match,’ on account of offers which the Emperor had made, and when
Francis wrote that the King’s proceedings only proved that he was jealous of the
negotiations for peace<a id="FNanchor_597_597"/><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>.
It is needless to state that neither of the proposed unions ever took place, and
Henry’s frantic endeavours to frustrate the steadily increasing amity of France
and Spain were entirely unavailing.</p>

<p>Matrimonial agitations being found useless to serve his purpose, Henry had
recourse to other methods to stir up suspicions between Charles and Francis, and
to prevent the dreaded peace. Whatever malicious tale-bearing and false representations
could accomplish was used to the full by the King and his minister. Cromwell wrote
to Sir Thomas Wyatt at the Spanish Court, directing him to ‘declare how the frenche
men show themself<i>es</i> so ernest to put al in the king<i>es</i> hand <i>tha</i>t
they offer vpon any significac<i>i</i>on <i>tha</i>t themp<i>er</i>o<i>ur</i> woll
make <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> to condescende to the same,’ and telling how the French ambassador had
promised that Henry ‘shuld for the French king<i>es</i> p<i>ar</i>te haue the hole
and entier manyeng of the Peax betwen him and Themper<i>or</i><a id="FNanchor_598_598"/><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>.’
If Henry could not obtain the ‘hole and entier manyeng of the Peax,’ he did his
best to convince Charles and Francis separately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
that his own friendship was more valuable to each of them than that of the other.
Furthermore he took pains to assure each one of the two rivals apart, that the
other prized England’s amity so much that great concessions would be necessary to
regain it.</p>

<p>But in spite of all Henry’s efforts to avert it, the news of the truce between
Charles and Francis and of their subsequent interview at Aigues Mortes reached
England in July, 1538<a id="FNanchor_599_599"/><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>.
Still so confident was the King in the wisdom of his original policy of strengthening
England solely by attempts to embroil these two powerful sovereigns under cover of
offers of mediation, that he refused definitely to abandon it, in spite of the
threatening outlook on the Continent. He remembered that the situation there had
often changed before, and saw that it would probably do so again. He encouraged
himself with hopes that in spite of the failure of his attempts to contract a
marriage in France, he might still gain the hand of the Duchess of Milan, and with
the reflection that the inroads of the Turk into the Emperor’s dominions would be
a serious hindrance to any direct attack upon England. He was unwilling to seek
security in an outside alliance, for fear of imperilling his hard-won position as
a neutral between France and Spain. He wished still to rely solely on judicious
interference in the affairs of Charles and Francis for England’s safety.</p>

<p>But with Cromwell the case was very different. The closing months of the year
1538 were the turning-point in his career, for they saw him take a step which was
destined to bring him into collision with the King, and later to lead him to his
death. The original difference of opinion between King and minister, which first
came to the fore in the quarrel of 1536, now broke forth again under a slightly
altered form, which it was destined to maintain till the end. At first we saw that
Cromwell vented his distrust of the policy of neutrality in favouring a definite
alliance with Spain. The changed situation on the Continent rendered a league with
Charles impossible now, so that the only refuge that remained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
for England, if the policy which had been so successful in 1536 and 1537 really
broke down, was to court an alliance with some power outside the two great continental
rivals. And Cromwell, inexperienced, and overestimating the danger of foreign
invasion, certainly believed that Henry’s efforts to maintain his old position
between France and Spain were now doomed to inevitable failure. He did not see, as
the King did, that the friendship of Charles and Francis was but temporary, and
that the old quarrels were ultimately certain to break forth afresh. He looked the
situation as it was squarely in the face, abandoned once and for all the policy of
seeking safety by playing on the mutual jealousies of Charles and Francis; he
frankly recognized the probability of war, and deliberately courted an outside
league for England’s defence. As he had always considered the friendship of the
Emperor more valuable than that of Francis, so he considered his enmity, which he
now regarded as inevitable, as more to be feared. Consequently, in looking about
for an alliance to fortify England, he sought one which could be most effectively
directed against Charles.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in order to guard against the danger of a possible
coalition of the Emperor and the King of France in 1533 and 1534, some proposals
had been made for a league with the Protestant princes of Germany; but that owing
to theological differences, the Lübeck affair, and the death of Katherine and its
results, the scheme had been abandoned as useless. As long as the interests of
France and Spain were separated, the value of the German alliance as a defensive
measure was of course lost, and England thought no more of it. But now that the
news of the interview of Aigues Mortes had persuaded Cromwell that mere meddling
in the affairs of France and Spain was not sufficient to prevent a coalition
against England, he turned to his forsaken friends in Germany once more. Cromwell
must have had great difficulty in bringing Henry to sanction a move to seek friendship
with the Lutherans, but so hopeless did the King’s efforts to prevent a cordial
relation between Charles and Francis appear, that he was at last induced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
consent to the experiment, though, as we shall soon see, his acquiescence was only
temporary. The opportunity for an alliance with the Germans was in many respects
most favourable. The proclamation which Henry had put forth to show his contempt
of the Papal authority to convoke a General Council, coupled with the Ten Articles
of 1536, had called forth the most hearty approbation of the Lutheran princes. An
elaborate set of instructions in the hand of one of the King’s secretaries directed
Christopher Mont to go to the Germans again, and tell them how nearly Henry’s
theological views coincided with their own, and to request them to send representatives
to discuss with him points of faith<a id="FNanchor_600_600"/><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>.
The fact that the proposals for the German alliance ostensibly emanated from the
King, is no sign that Cromwell was not the real originator of it. An invitation to
send ambassadors could scarcely proceed from any other source than the Crown, so
that the evidence afforded by the authorship of the instructions to Mont is of
small weight; whereas the course of events in 1539 and 1540 leaves little doubt
that the guiding hand throughout was that of the King’s minister. Henry’s name
really appeared as little as possible in connexion with the Lutheran alliance from
first to last, and only in the most formal manner. Cromwell’s was the moving
spirit in it throughout, and Henry really never cordially supported him, but
regarded the measure in the light of a disagreeable necessity, temporarily forced
upon him by the apparent failure of his own plans.</p>

<p>But the outside world of course knew nothing of the difference of opinion
between King and minister, and had no suspicion that the foundations were being
laid here for the quarrel which was later to bring Cromwell to disaster. The
Lutherans were greatly flattered by the proposals that had been made to them, and
in May an embassy, headed by Franz Burckhard, Vice-Chancellor of Saxony, arrived
in England. But in spite of all the trouble that had been taken, the plans of the
King’s minister were not destined to bear fruit, for the only result of the
Lutheran embassy was procrastination which seemed little better than failure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Theological differences were the ostensible reason for inability to conclude an
agreement, but not the real one. The Protestantism of the Lutherans differed from
that of Henry and Cromwell in much the same way as that of Tyndale, years before:
they cared for their theology for its own sake, and not, like Henry, as a means to
an end, as a stepping-stone to political greatness. A theological <i>entente</i>,
however, would have been possible, had Cromwell and Henry united to bring it about;
but they did not. The true reason for the failure to conclude an agreement was the
obstinacy of the King, which asserted itself at the very moment that his minister
had hoped to gain his complete consent to the proposed alliance. In the midst of
the negotiations with the Lutherans, Henry’s faith in his old policy had been
suddenly revived by the news that the extensive preparations of the Emperor, which
he at first had feared were to be aimed at England, were in reality directed against
the Turk<a id="FNanchor_601_601"/><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>:
the King was at least persuaded that he had no cause to fear an attack in the
immediate future. Gardiner in Paris, moreover, had been steadily working to defeat
the plans of Cromwell<a id="FNanchor_602_602"/><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a>,
and at the crucial moment his efforts appear to have borne fruit. The King refused
to commit himself any further to the policy to which he had given his temporary
sanction, but which, if definitely adopted, would have seriously hampered his own
schemes. The most that Cromwell could do was to persuade the King to keep up the
appearance of amity, and not to cut himself off from all chances of returning to
his Lutheran friends at a later date. So the envoys were sent home in October,
with a letter to the Elector of Saxony, telling him that his representatives had
given assurance of such sound erudition and Christian piety, as would certainly
lead to the best results; but as the matter of the negotiations concerned the glory
of Christ and the discipline of religion, it required much more mature deliberation,
and that a second embassy would have to be sent over before matters could be
concluded<a id="FNanchor_603_603"/><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a>.
For Cromwell, the dismissal of the Lutherans amounted to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
a second rebuke from the King, for meddling in foreign affairs; but this time the
minister did not humbly accept the rebuff as he had done before, but continued to
oppose his schemes to those of his master.</p>

<p>Thus at the close of the year 1538, England was trembling at the prospect of a
coalition of France and Spain against her. The outlook was certainly alarming, and
demanded united action at home. But at this very moment the King and his minister
could not agree on the best method of averting the peril which was threatening.
Each adopted his own way of meeting it, and the history of the year 1539 is the
story of the varying success of the two methods when brought into conflict. We
shall see that fortune twice inclined to favour Cromwell, only to desert him,
after he had become so hopelessly committed to the policy which he had adopted in
face of the opposition of the King, that there was no drawing back, and he paid
the penalty for his rashness with his life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE CATHOLIC REACTION AND THE ALLIANCE WITH CLEVES</p>

<p>The first few months of the new year brought no improvement in the state of
England’s foreign affairs. Having postponed the Lutheran alliance which Cromwell
had so strongly advocated in the end of 1538, for fear of losing his position of
neutrality between France and Spain, Henry was driven back on his own policy of
seeking safety for England in direct negotiations with Charles and Francis. Matrimonial
agitations had failed—malicious tale-bearing had not borne fruit, so the King took
the more straightforward course of making direct complaints that he was spoken of
with too little respect in foreign parts. He sent grumbling letters to his
neighbours, accusing them of permitting evil reports to be circulated about him.
He caused the President of the Council of the North to request James of Scotland
to suppress and punish the authors of several ‘spyttfull ballades,’ which had been
published about the wrongfully usurped authority of the King of England, and also
wrote to Wyatt in Spain, commanding him to protest against the malicious and
unreasonable lies of the ‘barking prechers ther’ who slandered him behind his
back<a id="FNanchor_604_604"/><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>.
But these petty remonstrances had no effect in diminishing the growing cordiality
of Francis and Charles, or their hatred of England: in fact the two continental
sovereigns seemed better friends than ever. On January 12, representatives of both
monarchs met at Toledo and concluded an agreement not to make any new alliances,
either political or matrimonial, with the King of England, without each other’s
consent<a id="FNanchor_605_605"/><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>.
The news of this treaty was a deathblow to Henry’s hopes; and the King was reluctantly
forced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[243]</a></span> admit that his
minister’s scheme of a German alliance offered better chances of safety for England
than any other. So he again gave his consent to a renewal of negotiations for an
outside league, though, as we shall soon see, it was on a basis somewhat different
from that of the previous ones.</p>

<p>Disappointed by the King’s refusal definitely to accept the alliance for which
he had laboured so hard, Cromwell had meantime been amusing himself with a very
feeble plan for gaining friends against the Pope, the chimerical nature of which
was quite at variance with the direct and practical character of most of his schemes.
He had proposed a league of England with the Dukes of Ferrara, Mantua, and Urbino
against his Holiness, who had just challenged the title of the latter to the dukedom
of Camerino. An interesting set of instructions to Cromwell’s friend Edmund Harvell
at Venice tells the story of this negotiation very vividly<a id="FNanchor_606_606"/><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>.
But the princes of northern Italy were too weak and the scheme itself was too
remote and far-fetched to promise any real advantage, and Cromwell doubtless lost
all interest in it as soon as the King again consented to approach the Germans.
The fact that three months had been suffered to elapse since the return of the
envoys in 1538, without an acceptance of the King’s invitation to send other
representatives to discuss theological points, simply proves that Henry’s treatment
of the first embassy had not been such as to encourage the Lutherans to
persevere<a id="FNanchor_607_607"/><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>.
But now that the King had again veered round to Cromwell’s policy, he ‘mervayled
not a litel’ at the slowness of the Germans, and sent Christopher Mont over to the
Court of the Elector of Saxony on January 25 to discover the feelings of John
Frederic and the Landgrave of Hesse, the leaders of the Schmalkaldic League,
towards the Emperor, to inquire further into their attitude on the tenets about
which they had so fruitlessly disputed with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the English bishops in the preceding summer, and finally to learn whether the Duke
of Cleves and his son were of the ‘old popisshe fasshyon’ or no<a id="FNanchor_608_608"/><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a>.
Appended to these very non-committal injunctions are certain others from Cromwell
himself of quite a different nature<a id="FNanchor_609_609"/><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>.
Completely dodging the theological issue, which he wisely left entirely in the
King’s hands, Cromwell took up the question of the German alliance from a new and
far more practical side, the matrimonial. He instructed Mont to suggest to the
Vice-Chancellor Burckhard the possibility of two marriages; one between the young
Duke of Cleves and the Princess Mary, and the other between Anne, the elder of the
two unmarried daughters of the old Duke, and the King himself<a id="FNanchor_610_610"/><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a>.
It appears that Cromwell had already discussed the feasibility of the first of
these two matches with the Vice-Chancellor, when the latter had been in England in
the previous summer, and John Frederic had subsequently written to the King’s minister
that the plan met with his entire approval. The proposal for Henry’s marriage, on
the contrary, was now brought forward for the first time. We shall soon see why it
was that Mont was sent to the Elector of Saxony, rather than to the Duke of Cleves
himself, to feel the way for these two alliances.</p>

<p>In order to understand the precise bearing on the foreign affairs of England of
the two marriages which Cromwell proposed, and of the political league which would
naturally go with them, we must make a slight digression here and examine the very
peculiar position in which the Duke of Cleves found himself at this juncture.
Various political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span> considerations,
above all an increasing jealousy of the power of the House of Saxony, had led the
Emperor Maximilian in 1496 to declare Maria, the only child of the Duke of Juliers
and Berg, to be the lawful heiress of these two provinces; a step which was in
direct contravention of a grant which Maximilian, at his election as King of the
Romans, had made to Frederic the Wise of the reversion of Juliers and Berg in case
of failure of male heirs in the ducal line there. This grant was definitely revoked
in various documents of the years 1508 and 1509; and Duke John of Cleves, who in
the meantime had married the heiress Maria of Juliers and Berg, was permitted to
unite these three rich provinces in his own hand, and to establish a strong power
on the Lower Rhine which prevented undue preponderance of the House of Wettin, and
furnished a useful support for the Hapsburgs in the western part of the Empire<a id="FNanchor_611_611"/><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a>.
The peace-loving Duke John lived and died in friendship with Maximilian and his
grandson, although his desire to see a reform in the Church had prevented his definite
acceptance of the Imperial invitation to join a Catholic League against the
Schmalkaldner in 1537. Instead he devoted himself to strengthening his power in
his own possessions by a series of wise and prudent measures, through which he
welded the three component parts of his dominions into one<a id="FNanchor_612_612"/><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>.
But during the last year of his life (which ended on February 6, 1539, while Mont
was on his way to the Saxon Court) affairs took a turn which was destined to bring
his son and heir William into direct conflict with the Empire. In June, 1538, the
warlike Duke Charles of Gelderland, whose possessions lay next to the province of
Cleves on the north, died leaving no children. His life had been spent in a struggle
against the pretensions to his hereditary dominions brought forward by the Emperor
as heir of Charles the Bold, and in order to prevent the substantiation of the
Imperial claims at his death he had planned to leave his lands to the King<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
of France<a id="FNanchor_613_613"/><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>.
This scheme however had encountered strong opposition from the estates of Gelderland,
who regarded with little favour a proposal so threatening to their comparatively
independent position, and Duke Charles was finally forced, much against his will,
to designate young William of Cleves as his successor. The latter, though by
nature weak and irresolute, was not in a position to refuse the chance which
fortune had thrown in his way: he accepted the proffered inheritance, and the
death of his father soon after left him in full possession of the four rich
provinces<a id="FNanchor_614_614"/><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a>.</p>

<p>The result was that he immediately became involved in a serious quarrel with
the Emperor, who realizing how dangerous a rival to his own power had been created
by the events just recounted, reasserted his claims to Gelderland even more
strongly than before. In looking for allies against Charles, Duke William naturally
turned to the Elector of Saxony, whose rights to Juliers and Berg, once rudely
revoked by Maximilian, had not been forgotten, but who seems to have preserved
sufficiently friendly relations with the family in favour of which his claims had
been set aside, to marry Sibylla, one of the sisters of the Duke<a id="FNanchor_615_615"/><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>.
Common enmity to Charles V. now drew them very close together, and at the Imperial
Court it was actually thought that Cleves had been formally admitted to the
Schmalkaldic League<a id="FNanchor_616_616"/><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>.
This however was a mistake. Though Duke William was certainly not opposed to the
Lutheran doctrines, he had not as yet made open confession of the Protestant faith;
and for that reason the Elector and the Landgrave had steadily refused to make a
political alliance with him<a id="FNanchor_617_617"/><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>.
Still he was on very intimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
terms with John Frederic, who had promised, when he wedded Sibylla of Cleves, to
advance money for the marriage of her sisters, and thus had a certain right to be
consulted when husbands were to be chosen for them. Henry was doubtless well aware
of all this, and it was consequently at the Saxon Court that Mont was instructed
to obtain information about the Duke of Cleves, and if possible to pave the way for
the two matrimonial alliances from which Cromwell hoped so much.</p>

<p>Having completed this preliminary survey of the position of the Duke of Cleves,
we are enabled to make some interesting observations on the instructions to the
English ambassador. It is very significant that the inquiries which Mont was ordered
to make concerning the religious tendencies of Duke William were concerned only
with his attitude towards the Pope. Of course the King could not consistently ally
himself with firm adherents of the Holy See after the events of the past ten years;
but it is also of the utmost importance to notice that he apparently preferred a
league with powers which he knew had not definitely committed themselves to the
New Faith to an alliance with the Schmalkaldner. Else why did he rather seek to
unite with Cleves than with Saxony? Both were politically valuable, as enemies of
the Emperor; the only difference was that Cleves was not as yet avowedly Protestant,
and Saxony was. It is possible that the idea which bore fruit five months later in
the Six Articles had already taken shape in Henry’s mind; at least it seems
certain that he was determined to keep a perfectly free hand in religious affairs,
so as not to be hampered in his political relations with France and Spain. Thus
when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span> Cromwell at last succeeded
in persuading him reluctantly to return to a German alliance, it was really only
half a victory for the minister. There was this great difference between the league
with the Lutherans which Cromwell had proposed and which never succeeded, and the
Cleves alliance which was now sought. The one would have been necessarily both
political and religious (for we have seen that the Lutherans had always refused to
join with England until a satisfactory theological agreement could be made), while
the other was solely political. It was simply another expression of the old
disagreement between Henry and Cromwell. The King, always looking for a chance of
reconciliation with Charles and Francis, refused to enter an alliance the religious
conditions of which would greatly enhance the difficulty of a return to his favourite
scheme. He was only induced to enter a purely political league, which he doubtless
felt he could throw over at any moment if he wished to do so; an agreement both
political and religious he might have found it more difficult to escape from.
Cromwell on the other hand, having definitely given up all ideas of direct
negotiations with France and Spain, wished to plunge headlong into the Lutheran
alliance, caring little what he was committed to provided he gained solid support.
But, as we have seen, the King would not agree to this, and the alliance with
Cleves can thus only be regarded as a compromise between the royal and Cromwellian
policies, which the King could abandon whenever affairs in France and Spain took a
more favourable turn. Later events in the same year furnish further proofs of this
most important fact.</p>

<p>Furthermore the King had contrived that the responsibility for the proposed
league with Cleves should fall almost entirely on his minister’s shoulders, in
order that he himself might the more easily renounce it if occasion served. The
fact that the new alliance, if accomplished, would from its very nature commit him
to far less than the Lutheran league which he had put off in 1538, was not enough
for Henry; he must needs have other safeguards, and determined to make Cromwell
his scapegoat. All the practical and important<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
parts of the instructions to Mont were given by the King’s minister. The
conciliatory expressions with which Henry had directed the ambassador to sound the
Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse on the question of theology were
merely empty words, as is proved by the utter failure of an attempted agreement
four months later. Their sole object was to induce John Frederic more favourably
to receive the practical proposals which followed. But the King purposely left to
Cromwell the task of framing the vital part of the message, and it is evident that
he gave his consent to the proposals it contained only in the most guarded and
non-committal manner. We are merely told that as regards the match proposed for
the Princess Mary, Cromwell perceived ‘the king<i>es</i> hieghnes <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> by his
grac<i>es</i> counten<i>au</i>nce and exterior Visage <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> to be of good
Inclinac<i>i</i>on<a id="FNanchor_618_618"/><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>.’
On the more vital question of the King’s attitude concerning his own marriage, the
instructions of Cromwell to Mont give us even vaguer information. The fact was
that the King was willing definitely to bind Cromwell, but not himself, to a plan
which he had resolved to abandon the moment that any favourable alteration should
take place in his relations with France and Spain. From the day that Mont departed
on his mission, the fate of the alliance with Cleves and the fate of Thomas
Cromwell were joined together beyond the possibility of separation.</p>

<p>We unfortunately do not possess the letter in which Mont and his companion, a
certain Thomas Paynell, reported their first reception at the Saxon Court, but the
reply of Cromwell on March 10 gives us considerable information about the success
of the ambassadors<a id="FNanchor_619_619"/><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>.
John Frederic had apparently welcomed the prospect of the two marriages by which
Henry proposed to bind himself to Cleves, and had promised, through Burckhard, to
do his best to bring them about. Cromwell’s letter goes on to direct Mont to follow
up the advantage already gained by telling bad stories about Charles, and to ‘inculcate
and p<i>er</i>suade vnto the said duke and landisgrave the moment &amp; i<i>m</i>porta<i>n</i>ce
of that grudge, which the<i>m</i>pero<i>ur<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></i>
doth beire, for the Bishop of Rom<i>es</i> pleas<i>ure</i> against them and oth<i>e</i>r
of the avangelik sorte, which they may nowe easely p<i>er</i>ceive by that he worketh
and goeth aboute.’ At the same time, another embassy, headed by a certain Dr.
Nicholas Wotton, was sent to Cleves to obtain confirmation of the promises of
Burckhard, and further to carry on negotiations for a supply of gunners and
artillerymen to be furnished to Henry in case he should need them; and finally to
signify the King’s willingness to make an offensive and defensive league with Duke
William<a id="FNanchor_620_620"/><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>.
The latter was at first less eager to accept the alliance which England offered
than his brother-in-law was to promote it: he wanted to postpone a definite answer
in the hope that he might yet come to a peaceful solution of his difficulty with
the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_621_621"/><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>.
But as this prospect daily grew more and more remote, he became correspondingly
willing to entertain Henry’s proposals, and the outlook for the accomplishment of
the practical part of Cromwell’s plan seemed very favourable. The comparatively
unimportant overtures for theological reconciliation with the Elector and the
Landgrave were apparently at first received with less enthusiasm by the Lutherans,
who had already had some experience of the King’s vacillating policy and evidently
thought it a little suspicious that Henry had suddenly become so very urgent. We
have seen that the King’s proposals for a religious agreement were chiefly intended
as a blind to cover the more practical matrimonial proposals which had followed,
but Cromwell evidently thought it worth while to keep up the deception as a
precaution. A second letter from the King’s minister directs Mont and Paynell to
continue to urge on the Elector and Landgrave the importance of theological unity,
and to ‘conduce to haue them somw[hat reproved for] ou<i>er</i>sight &amp; slakenes,
in shewing [so little] gratuite, and by that for to pryk th[em to] redubb the same
and give you more f[avourable] a<i>n</i>swer.’</p>

<p>And at first Cromwell’s eagerness for the alliance with Cleves seemed to have
every justification, for Henry’s policy in other parts of Europe appeared to have
failed even more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> completely
than before. Ominous letters were received from Wriothesley, the ambassador in the
Netherlands, who did not hesitate to express his fear that war would soon come and
that his retreat to England would be cut off<a id="FNanchor_622_622"/><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a>.
At the same time Chapuys received orders to return to the Court of the Queen Regent,
and Cromwell consequently instructed Wriothesley to demand leave to depart<a id="FNanchor_623_623"/><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>.
The exchange was finally effected, but that there was deep distrust on both sides
is proved by Cromwell’s orders for the detention of Chapuys at Calais, until the
safety of Wriothesley was assured, and by the instructions of the Queen Regent to
the Provost of Mons to follow the English ambassador to Gravelines<a id="FNanchor_624_624"/><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>.
But fortunately these precautions were unnecessary; no open act of hostility took
place, and the crisis seemed at least temporarily tided over by the arrival of the
Dean of Cambray in London to replace Chapuys, and by the reception of Stephen
Vaughan at Brussels in Wriothesley’s stead<a id="FNanchor_625_625"/><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>.
But the attitude of France was more disquieting. On February 5 Castillon was
recalled, and though he made a vague promise at his departure that another should
be sent in his place, the anxiety at the Court was but little relieved thereby.
The most that Cromwell could do, was to take care that the French ambassador should
carry back to his master full accounts of the excellence of England’s defences,
and her readiness for war. So he took him, as he later wrote to the King, to his
armoury, showing him a ‘store of harneys and wepens <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> the whiche he semed to
esteme moche,’ and telling him that there were twenty more armouries in the realm
as well or better equipped; ‘wherat he woundred and sayd that he thought yo<i>ur</i>
grace the prince best furnished thereof in Chr<i>ist</i>endom<a id="FNanchor_626_626"/><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a>.’</p>

<p>But though Cromwell may have exaggerated the security of England’s fortifications,
his words to Castillon were by no means empty. Though the King and his minister may
have had differences of opinion in regard to the conduct of foreign affairs, in
the internal management of the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they were, as always, united. Here Henry suffered himself to be guided at all
points by Cromwell. And at no time is the masterfulness of the latter’s domestic
administration better exhibited, than by his action at home the moment the first
rumours of an invasion reached England. Countless memoranda, lists of men fit for
military service, arms, ammunition, provisions, and other necessaries of warfare,
all in his hand, or in that of one of his clerks, attest his industry and ability
in preparing the country to repel the dreaded invasion. All reports of the state
of the coast defences at various places were sent to him. General musters were
ordered throughout the realm; every precaution was taken to fortify all vulnerable
points. Beacons were placed upon all the hills, and no detail that could add to
the strength and efficiency of the defences was left out<a id="FNanchor_627_627"/><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a>.</p>

<p>But just at this very moment, when everything seemed to point to an open
rupture with Charles and Francis, when the schemes which Cromwell had opposed to
those of the King seemed to have every justification, an event occurred which
totally changed the aspect of affairs, and restored Henry’s badly shaken confidence
in his own ability to stave off the threatened crisis without the aid of outside
alliances or an appeal to arms. This event was the arrival in England on March 28
of a new French ambassador, Charles de Marillac, who had come to replace Castillon.
So long a time had elapsed since the departure of the latter that Henry had
probably given up all hope of the fulfilment of the vague prospects that had been
held out that a successor might be appointed. But the unexpected appearance of
Marillac at once revived the King’s drooping spirits. The letters in which the
ambassador reported his reception at the English Court to Francis and Montmorency
give us a vivid picture of the universal joy with which this apparent reassurance
of friendship with France was hailed<a id="FNanchor_628_628"/><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>.
Henry was delighted, and his satisfaction was increased when Marillac, at his
master’s command, followed up the advantage already gained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
by renewed assertions of the cordiality of France. The whole Court seemed ‘to wear
a new aspect and to be quite delighted<a id="FNanchor_629_629"/><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a>.’
Had Henry seen the letter of instructions which Marillac received from the French
Court, he would have realized that Francis was only endeavouring ‘to keep him in
good humour<a id="FNanchor_630_630"/><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>,’
while making a little more certain of his own relations with Charles; and he might
have been less encouraged. But Marillac’s cordiality seems to have put him off his
guard, and he was led, in his exultation, to welcome the apparent friendship of
Francis in ways which very nearly resulted in the permanent stultification of all
the laborious efforts of Cromwell to maintain amicable relations in Germany. The
events which took place in England in the three months following the arrival of
the French ambassador furnish ample proof of this new departure in the royal policy.</p>

<p>On April 28 Parliament had met, its assembling being indispensable to carrying
on the ‘Kinges busynes.’ Cromwell had practically appointed every member, in order
that Henry might have a ‘tractable’ House. His usual methods of ‘ordering’ the
elections of members have already been described; suffice it to say that in this
case he had completely outdone himself; the Parliament of 1539 was undoubtedly his
masterpiece<a id="FNanchor_631_631"/><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>.
It will be remembered that it was in this session that he first succeeded in forcing
the Lords and Commons to sanction the statute by which royal proclamations were
given the force of laws. Cromwell’s ‘remembrance’ for other Acts to be passed in
the Parliament of 1539 is also noteworthy. It makes casual mention of the attainders
of Exeter, Salisbury, and Pole, of plans for the fortification of the coast, and
then designates the scheme out of which the Six Articles were later evolved as ‘A
devise in the parliament for the vnitie in religion<a id="FNanchor_632_632"/><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>.’
It is very improbable that Cromwell had any really accurate information concerning
the King’s real intentions in connexion with this last item. Henry had purposely
concealed them under a very non-committal statement. Doubtless the King had long
cherished the idea of making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
use of a declaration that in matters of doctrine England still adhered to the Old
Faith, to facilitate a reconciliation with Charles and Francis; for such a statement
would remove the main pretext of the Emperor and the French King for an attack on
him, namely that they were undertaking a crusade to suppress heresy. But so hopeless
had been the outlook in the early part of the year, that Henry had not had the
courage to try this experiment. He was rather led to shun all moves which would
imperil his friendly relations with Germany, so that he had scrupulously avoided
any direct statement which could lead to the belief that a Catholic reaction was
possible. But the assurances of Marillac had revived all his enthusiasm for his
old policy. He now abandoned all caution, and promptly proceeded to disclose his
real ideas in regard to the ‘vnitie in religion.’ When Cromwell discovered the
true state of affairs he must have been dismayed; he probably already felt how
deeply he had become involved in the German alliance, and saw that the new trend
which things had taken boded no good to him. His position was now a very uncomfortable
one, and the fact that a committee of bishops under his superintendence was utterly
unable to cope with the difficulties of the newly presented religious problem, is
very significant. Henry was not to be balked however. He quickly took the matter
out of the hands of the incompetent bishops, and placed it before the Lords; finally,
to make assurance doubly sure, he came to them in person, ‘and confounded them all
with Goddes Lerning<a id="FNanchor_633_633"/><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a>.’
Henry’s theology was of course as unimpeachable as it was confounding, and his
energy was rewarded before the middle of June by the definite passage in Parliament
of the Statute of the Six Articles. The doctrine of Transubstantiation was
confirmed, communion in both kinds was pronounced unnecessary, the marriage of
priests was forbidden, all vows of chastity were to be strictly observed, and
private masses and auricular confession were adjudged meet and expedient<a id="FNanchor_634_634"/><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>.</p>

<p>In spite of the radically Catholic nature of the doctrines<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
proclaimed in this Act, however, Henry took good care that there should be no
mistake about his attitude towards the Pope. He was committed to hostility to the
See of Rome beyond the possibility of escape, and he knew it. Though political
expediency, internal and foreign, had led him to proclaim the catholicity of the
Church of England in matters of doctrine, no consideration whatever could induce
him to make the least concession to the Papacy. In fact he took measures to show,
simultaneously with the passage of the Six Articles, that his contempt of the See
of Rome was stronger than ever. Marillac wrote that on June 15 there was played on
the river in the King’s presence ‘a game of poor grace, much less invention, of
two galleys, one carrying the King’s arms, the other the Pope’s, with several
Cardinals’ hats (so he was told, for he would have deemed it contrary to duty to
be a spectator). The galleys fought a long time, and ultimately those of the King
were victorious, and threw the Pope and Cardinals and their arms into the water,
to show people that this King will entirely confound and abolish the power of the
Holy Father<a id="FNanchor_635_635"/><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>.’
Demonstrations like this were of course mainly intended to impress people at home.
Let us now examine the effect of the Six Articles abroad, first in Germany, and
then in France and Spain.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></p>

<p>The rather large hopes of a religious agreement which Henry had held out to the
leaders of the Schmalkaldic League early in the year, merely as a bait to induce them
to favour the political alliance with Cleves, had finally, owing to Cromwell’s representations,
been accepted in all seriousness by John Frederic of Saxony and Philip of Hesse.
They soon sent over another embassy under the leadership of Burckhard and Ludwig
von Baumbach, a councillor of the Landgrave, which arrived in London on April 23.
Henry was not yet quite sure of his ground with Marillac, and had not fully decided
what note should be struck in the ‘devise in the parliament for the vnitie in religion,’
so at first he received the Germans cordially<a id="FNanchor_636_636"/><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a>.
On April 29 they were granted an audience, in which Henry, though he carefully avoided
committing himself to any definite promises of an alliance, spoke in the warmest terms
of the Elector and Landgrave, cautioned the Lutherans against the treachery of the
Emperor, and boasted long and loud because of the recent collapse of an expedition
against England which, according to Wriothesley’s report, had been preparing in Flanders
since the previous February<a id="FNanchor_637_637"/><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>.
A subsequent interview of the ambassadors with Cromwell and other members of the Privy
Council was equally satisfactory, and Burckhard and Baumbach were convinced that their
mission would ultimately be crowned with success. Had they understood the meaning of
the many excuses which were offered for the failure to begin definite negotiations at
once, the opening of Parliament and the difficulty of gaining access to the King,
they might have been less encouraged. Henry merely wished to detain them until he
had made perfectly sure that they could be of no more use to him. His relations with
France were improving every day, but he had not yet made sure of the state of affairs
in the dominions of the Emperor. On February 24, at Frankfort, the Electors of Brandenburg
and the Palatinate had opened negotiations with the Imperial plenipotentiary, the
Archbishop of Lund, in the hope of mediating between Charles and the princes of the
Schmalkaldic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span> League<a id="FNanchor_638_638"/><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>;
Henry had determined to learn the result of this meeting before giving the ambassadors
a definite answer. The news of the truce concluded between the Emperor and the Lutherans
on the 19th of April was finally announced in London towards the middle of May: it
at once decided the King to send the envoys home empty-handed again, for it was obviously
useless to continue negotiations for an alliance, which was primarily to have been
directed against the very power with which the Schmalkaldner had just made a temporary
peace. So much had Henry been encouraged by the favourable signs of the past few weeks,
that he would probably have succeeded in finding an excuse for dismissing Burckhard
and Baumbach, even if the result of the negotiations between the Emperor and the Schmalkaldner
had been reversed; as it was he was spared the trouble of exercising much ingenuity,
for, most unfortunately for the ambassadors, one of the clauses in the Frankfort agreement
contained a provision which in itself was quite sufficient to stultify all their efforts.
In the seventh article of their treaty with the Emperor, the Schmalkaldner had agreed
not to admit any new members into their league during the period of the truce. There
is every reason to think that this provision was especially directed against the
English negotiations, for both Brandenburg and the Count Palatine had always looked
with disfavour on the attempts of Saxony and Hesse to gain the alliance of Henry,
and doubtless availed themselves of this opportunity to persuade the Schmalkaldner to
put an end to them. In any case the King lost no time in acting upon the intelligence
he had received, and at once complained to Burckhard and Baumbach, whose excuses
and explanations were of no avail. Wearisome disputes and attempts at a compromise
ensued: the question of reciprocity was discussed at length; the envoys insisting
that England was sure to derive quite as much benefit from the proposed alliance as
the Lutherans, the King and his ministers in turn demanding concessions which they
knew that the ambassadors were not authorized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
to grant. So reluctant were the latter to return without having accomplished anything
however, that it was only with the utmost difficulty that Henry finally succeeded in
getting rid of them. To a blunt request that they depart the envoys only replied
with continued petitions for a more favourable answer to their demands: finally,
with pleasing frankness, they begged that His Majesty would let himself be guided
by the truth alone in directing the religious controversies then in progress in
Parliament. Henry made no effort to conceal from Burckhard and Baumbach the anger
which this ill-timed and incautious request aroused in him, for he probably realized
that his best chance of hastening the departure of the Lutherans lay in involving
himself in some sort of an altercation with them. We are not surprised to read that
both parties immediately became engaged in a violent discussion concerning the celibacy
of the clergy—in the midst of which the ambassadors apparently beat a somewhat
precipitate retreat: they seem at last to have had the wit to realize that they
had to do with a theologian, with whom it was extremely dangerous to disagree. A
fruitless interview with Cromwell followed, and on May 31 the envoys finally
departed<a id="FNanchor_639_639"/><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>.
In the meantime the Elector and the Landgrave had continued to show touching but
unwarranted confidence in the sincerity of Henry’s professions, and had remained
in utter ignorance of the true state of affairs in England. Their hopes of a speedy
settlement of religious differences had doubtless received considerable encouragement
through the efforts of Dr. Barnes, who had been earnestly labouring to remove the
disagreeable impression which Henry had made on Christian III. by his blundering
Lübeck policy in 1534. Barnes had been sent to Hamburg for this purpose early in
the year. He was himself an ardent Protestant who never once suspected the possibility
of a Catholic reaction in England; and as his zeal more than supplied the lack of
diplomatic skill, his efforts seem to have met with great success<a id="FNanchor_640_640"/><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a>.
The King of Denmark was now in close<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
alliance with John Frederic, and Barnes was soon enabled to persuade them to
arrange to send a joint embassy to the King of England to treat of the political
league which was to follow a theological agreement<a id="FNanchor_641_641"/><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>.
But at this juncture Burckhard and Baumbach returned with a very discouraging
report, which obtained full confirmation by the news which arrived a week later,
that the Six Articles had actually been passed<a id="FNanchor_642_642"/><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>.
The enthusiasm of the Lutherans was of course considerably dampened, and they
wrote to Henry that if a league was to be treated of at all, he would have to be
the one to send ambassadors; they could not themselves venture to visit England
because of the machinations against the Evangelical cause there<a id="FNanchor_643_643"/><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>.
Even in Cleves, where Henry and Cromwell had sought an alliance of a purely political
nature, unhampered by religious restrictions, the news of the passage of the Six
Articles created profound distrust, and we may well believe that John Frederic
discouraged his brother-in-law from continuing negotiations with England, after
the proof of Henry’s perfidy that he had just received. We are not surprised to
find that the matrimonial projects which formed the basis of the alliance with
Cleves came to a complete standstill during the month of July. The proposals for a
match between Duke William and the Princess Mary had apparently never been very
popular: they were now definitely abandoned and never revived. To the other plan,
for a marriage of Henry and the Duchess Anne, an unexpected objection had arisen.
It appears that ever since 1527 a plan for a marriage between the King’s intended
bride and the son of Duke Anthony of Lorraine had been under discussion. For twelve
years the form of continuing the negotiations for this union had been kept up on
both sides, with the idea of bringing pressure on the Emperor, though all hope of
an actual completion of the match must have been abandoned long before this time.
But now that the union with England seemed less desirable, the Duke of Cleves of
course made the most of the opportunity of evading the requests of Henry that was
afforded by the Lorraine affair. The claims of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Duke Anthony and his son would have to be satisfied, he said, before his sister
could be offered to Henry<a id="FNanchor_644_644"/><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>.</p>

<p>Altogether it looked as if the German alliance would be abandoned, and Cromwell,
who of all people was most deeply involved in it, must have been roused to a sense
of his danger. But the threatened reversal of his policy was destined to be postponed
once more. For it soon appeared that the exultation of the King at the apparent
success of his own plans was premature. We have seen that it was largely in the
hope of conciliating Francis and Charles by removing their main pretext for an attack
on England that Henry had caused the Six Articles to be passed. But the Act did
not accomplish what was expected of it. The courtesy of Marillac had given Henry a
very exaggerated idea of the cordiality of France. He did not see that Francis was
merely dallying with him, and had no idea of a permanent friendship. The fact that
Charles had refused to listen to the proposals of Cardinal Pole had also been regarded
as a good omen<a id="FNanchor_645_645"/><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>.
But when it appeared that dread of the Turks, who had advanced up the Adriatic,
was the sole cause of the Emperor’s apparent unwillingness to offend England, and
it was rumoured that there was immediate prospect of another interview between him
and Francis, Henry discovered his mistake<a id="FNanchor_646_646"/><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a>.
All the fair hopes he had entertained of preventing the dreaded coalition against
England were apparently blasted. The doctrinal statement from which he had expected
so much had proved but a feeble weapon with which to arrest the current of continental
politics. He could consider himself fortunate if the Six Articles and his own personal
rudeness to the German ambassadors had not been sufficient to preclude all hope of
a return to the alliance, which a few months before he had abandoned as useless,
but which now seemed to offer the one chance for England’s safety. Once more the
policy of Cromwell seemed justified, and Henry was forced to acknowledge it.</p>

<p>Fortunately for England, the situation, alarming as it was, had even more terrors
for the Duke of Cleves than for Henry.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Charles’ refusal to ratify the treaty of Frankfort had once more blighted the hopes
of a peaceful solution of the difficulties in Germany<a id="FNanchor_647_647"/><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a>;
in May the outbreak of a serious rebellion in Ghent made it imperative for the
Emperor to appear in person in the Netherlands, and in early August Francis sent
him an invitation to pass through France on his way to the Low Countries. The
prospect that Charles, in close alliance with his former rival, would soon be
brought within striking distance of Gelderland, was by no means agreeable to Duke
William. It was fairly obvious that Charles would bend his energies to punishing
the Duke of Cleves for his contempt of the Imperial authority, before attempting
to chastise the King of England for the general weal of Christendom. The Duke of
Cleves was much more practical than his brother-in-law: like Henry he never let
religious considerations or conscientious scruples weigh against the dictates of
political expediency. As soon as the news of the Emperor’s invitation from Francis
was confirmed, Duke William’s doubts concerning the pre-contract of his sister Anne
and the son of the Duke of Lorraine were cleared up with gratifying celerity. He
probably had some difficulty in obtaining the consent of the more scrupulous John
Frederic to a renewal of the negotiations with England, but his urgency was such
that he triumphed over every obstacle. A messenger from Burckhard to Cromwell in
the end of August was followed in early September by four ambassadors from Cleves
and Saxony who were authorized to conclude the match<a id="FNanchor_648_648"/><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>.
The King must have been greatly relieved at the arrival of the envoys. Since May 3
he had heard nothing from his friends in Cleves except for the famous description
of his intended bride, which his ambassador Wotton had sent him, for lack of other
news. Anne appears to have been of very ‘lowly and gentle <span class="nowrap">conditions. . . .</span>  She
occupieth her time most with the needle, wherwithall she <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> She canne reede and

nor yet she canne not synge nor pleye <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> enye instrument, for they take it

enye knowledge of musike <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> your Graces servant Hanze Albein hathe taken theffigies

lyvelye<a id="FNanchor_649_649"/><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>.’
In the end it proved unfortunate for Cromwell that this letter, and the portrait
which Holbein made<a id="FNanchor_650_650"/><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
were not sufficient to turn the King against her, without the need of further
confirmation. But even if Wotton’s description had been far less flattering, it is
doubtful if he could have persuaded Henry to abandon the Cleves marriage at this
crisis. The King was now as reckless in accepting the alliance as he had been a
few months before in refusing it. He perhaps forgot that though his zeal for the
national welfare had never been hampered by religion or conscience, he had not yet
put his patriotism to the more practical test of a sacrifice of matrimonial bliss.
So the preliminaries of the match were hurried through with a speed quite as
remarkable as the delays in the previous negotiations with the Lutherans. The
ambassadors departed on October 6 to return to Cleves and conduct Anne to Calais,
where a noble company assembled to welcome her, Gregory Cromwell being among the
number<a id="FNanchor_651_651"/><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a>.
Such were the delays of travelling in those times (Wotton wrote to Cromwell that
the lady’s party could only make five miles a day<a id="FNanchor_652_652"/><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a>)
that Anne of Cleves did not arrive at Calais until December 11, and there she
waited till the 27th, for weather sufficiently favourable for her crossing<a id="FNanchor_653_653"/><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>.</p>

<p>Having landed, she proceeded to Canterbury, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Cranmer welcomed her with due pomp and ceremony. He had received from Cromwell
fifty sovereigns to be presented to her on her arrival, and promised to do his
best to induce the townspeople to give her fifty angels more<a id="FNanchor_654_654"/><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>.
From Canterbury Anne journeyed on to Sittingbourne and Rochester, where she was
received on December 31 by the Duke of Norfolk, with a great company of nobles<a id="FNanchor_655_655"/><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a>.
When Henry heard of her arrival there he determined to visit her in disguise, and,
accompanied by eight persons of his Privy Chamber, he rode down to Rochester on
New Year’s Day and saw for the first time his intended bride<a id="FNanchor_656_656"/><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>.
It is unfortunate that we possess no trustworthy information concerning the
impression which Anne made on Henry at this first meeting. A letter which Cromwell
wrote to the King, six months later, from the Tower states that when Henry, on his
return from Rochester, was asked how he liked the Queen, he had answered ‘hevelye
And not plesantlye “nothing so well as She was spokyn of”,’ and had added that had
he known as much as he then knew ‘she shold not haue Commen w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in
this Realme<a id="FNanchor_657_657"/><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>.’
It will be seen in a later chapter, however, that Cromwell wrote this letter under
circumstances which rendered it very improbable that he told the exact truth:
there is every reason to think that he greatly exaggerated the aversion which
Henry first conceived for Anne of Cleves. In any case if Henry felt any such
disgust as Cromwell described, he succeeded admirably in dissembling his feelings.
Two days after the meeting at Rochester, he rode in state to meet his bride at
Greenwich, and on January 6 he married her. ‘The sonday after,’ Hall adds, ‘there
were kepte solempne Justes, <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> on whiche daie she was appareiled after the Englishe
fassion, with a Frenche whode, whiche so set furth her beautie and good visage,
that euery creature reioysed to behold her<a id="FNanchor_658_658"/><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>.’</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></p>

<p>It is important to notice that even in this hour of national peril, Henry did
not make any overtures to the Elector of Saxony or the Landgrave of Hesse. Not
even the immediate prospect of war with France and Spain could induce him to go as
far as this and to bind himself by ties religious as well as political. Even Cromwell
had by this time discovered the uselessness of endeavouring to persuade the King
to return to an alliance of which he had never really approved; more than this, he
at last seemed to realize, that as advocate of a policy which his master had
definitely abandoned, he ran great danger of losing his influence if not his life.
It was rather late for him to attempt to break away from a plan with which his
name had become identified; but he saw that he must purchase safety at the cost of
consistency, and he took care in future to discourage all efforts of the Lutherans
to come to an agreement. The reception accorded to an embassy which the firm but
persistent Schmalkaldner sent to England in January 1540, and the words which
Cromwell spoke to the ambassador on that occasion give us a very clear insight
into the attitude of the King’s minister<a id="FNanchor_659_659"/><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>.
It was the last attempt which the Lutherans made to treat with England during
Cromwell’s ministry, and its failure marks the end of the negotiations which had
begun with the mission of Vaughan and Mont in 1533. Philip of Hesse had sent his
councillor, Ludwig von Baumbach, to Henry’s Court once more, with instructions to
express to the King his sorrow at the passage of the Six Articles, and his hope
that they would not lead to any action contrary to the word of God and the truth
of the Gospels. The Landgrave also trusted that the King would not suffer the
negotiations with the Lutherans to drop, but the ambassador was to make it clear
that a political alliance would be conditional, as always, on religious agreement<a id="FNanchor_660_660"/><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>.</p>

<p>Baumbach arrived early in January and immediately betook himself to Cromwell,
whom he evidently considered the best friend the Lutherans had at the English
Court. But this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> time he met
with a cold reception<a id="FNanchor_661_661"/><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>.
The minister kept asking him if he had power to conclude a political alliance—a
perfectly safe question, for no one knew better than Cromwell that the Lutherans
would insist on doctrinal reconciliation in the first place. Baumbach tried to
give an evasive answer, but was soon summoned to Henry, who repeated his minister’s
demand with still greater directness. The ambassador could only reply that he must
consult with Burckhard, who having returned with Anne of Cleves to England, was
still in London. On January 12 the two Lutherans had a conversation with Cromwell,
in which the latter defined his position with absolute clearness. He told the
ambassadors that the King desired a political alliance with them, but that this
must come first; the religious question could be settled later. Baumbach and
Burckhard answered that this was impossible; nothing could be done until a theological
agreement had been concluded. At this Cromwell could contain himself no longer.
With almost pathetic frankness he turned to the Lutherans and told them that he
plainly saw what they wanted in regard to religion; but, as the world stood then,
that he must hold to the same belief as his master, even if it cost him his life<a id="FNanchor_662_662"/><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a>.
Such was the faith of the man who six months later was brought to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the block on the charge of counter-working the King in matters of religion! There
is little need to dwell on the rest of Baumbach’s stay in England. He had another
interview with Henry, who, angered at the firmness of the Lutherans on the religious
question, now took occasion to throw contempt on their usefulness as political
allies. He told some preposterous lies to Baumbach, informing him that he had
heard nothing of the danger of the coalition of Charles and Francis of which the
envoy talked so much, although he had faithful ambassadors at both Courts. Even if
he were attacked, he said, he was fully able to defend himself, owing to England’s
insular position and strong navy, which was well manned by his own subjects.
German soldiers, on the contrary, would be of little use to him as sailors, for
they would certainly be always seasick. After making a few counter-proposals which
he knew would never be accepted, he dismissed Baumbach with a polite but non-committal
message to the Landgrave, and Cromwell, who bade the envoy farewell on January 21,
followed suit. But though the minister had used this last mission of the Lutherans
mainly as an opportunity to break away from the policy which he had hitherto
advocated, but which he now realized the danger of being connected with, his
efforts to save himself were too late. We shall see in the next chapter that the
events of the previous years had so thoroughly identified him with the Lutheran
alliance in the minds of the people, that his enemies were enabled to make use of
his supposed adherence to it, as a pretext for conspiring his ruin.</p>

<p>The Lutherans did not send another embassy to England for a long time. Negotiations
were not resumed until more than four years later, when the situation had entirely
changed, and even then they failed as signally as before. But though Henry had thus
dealt the death blow to the hopes of the Schmalkaldner, he did not suffer the year
1539 to close without attempting to form an alliance of a very different sort with
another prince of the Empire. As soon as he had heard of the failure of the plan
for the marriage of the Princess Mary and the Duke of Cleves, Henry began to look<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
about for another German husband for his daughter. It was doubtless with the royal
authority that Christopher Mont had let fall a casual hint in conversation with a
certain Nürnberg merchant named Gundelfynger, that Henry would gladly see Mary
wedded to a prince of the Empire. The merchant responded by proposing Duke Philip
of Bavaria as a suitable candidate for her hand. This prince was a member of the
Palatinate branch of the Wittelsbach family, and a nephew of the Elector Louis. He
had been a faithful servant of the Emperor and his brother Ferdinand in the first
outbreaks of the religious strife after the formation of the Schmalkaldic League,
and had been severely wounded in a brave attempt to oppose the Hessian lanzknechts
at the battle of Laufen<a id="FNanchor_663_663"/><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>.
In spite of the fact that he belonged to a notoriously wavering family, he appears
to have been a firm adherent of the Old Faith, at least at the time of which we
are speaking. But on the other hand he was certainly loyal to every tradition of
Wittelsbach impecuniosity. He had sacrificed all his property in the Emperor’s
service, and Charles had characteristically refused to make good his losses, and
had also insulted him by opposing his suit for the hand of the Duchess of Milan. A
financially successful marriage seemed to offer Philip the only chance of recovering
his lost fortunes, and it was at this juncture that the possibility of a match
with the daughter of the rich King of England was opened to him. The proposal of
Gundelfynger seems to have met with Henry’s approval, and he soon signified to
Philip his desire that the latter should visit him in England. The Duke jumped at
the chance to conclude a marriage which promised so many pecuniary advantages, and
his anger at the ingratitude of Charles certainly did not make him any less anxious
to listen to Henry’s proposals. He arrived in London on December 8<a id="FNanchor_664_664"/><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>,
and at first the negotiations for the match proceeded with unexpected rapidity.
Against two points on which Henry insisted, however, Philip raised strong
objections<a id="FNanchor_665_665"/><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>:
the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> was that he
should take Mary as a bastard, ‘incapable by the laws and statutes of the realm of
claiming any succession or title by right of inheritance,’ The second was the King’s
refusal to except the name of the Pope from the list of those against whom the
financial and political agreement which was to accompany the marriage was to be
concluded: Philip, as a faithful Catholic, was apparently at first unwilling to
enter a league which might bring him into conflict with the See of Rome. But the
firmness of the King, coupled with the great financial profits which the match
promised to Philip, finally triumphed over the religious scruples of the Wittelsbacher,
and on January 24 he signed a treaty in which he accepted the marriage and the
compact under the conditions on which Henry insisted: the agreement, however, was
not to be considered binding unless Philip could get it ratified by his relatives
in Germany before Whitsuntide, 1540. He left England, January 27, for this purpose,
but his attempts were unsuccessful, and the proposal came to nothing. It was taken
up a second time at a later date, and again abandoned. But though the scheme finally
fell through there are a few interesting things to be noticed in connexion with
the negotiations for it, which serve to make clear the trend things were taking at
the time of Philip’s visit in London.</p>

<p>The whole affair was carried on so secretly, and we have so little documentary
evidence, that it is very difficult to form any certain conclusions concerning this
attempted compact. The name of Cromwell figures prominently in connexion with it;
we find Duke Philip consulting with the minister at his house, and visiting the Princess
Mary in his company<a id="FNanchor_666_666"/><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>;
but it is pretty obvious that all the negotiations were conducted throughout with
the full approval of the King, and not, as was the case with the Lutheran affair,
partially in opposition to the royal wishes. For the scheme was radically different
from the proposed Lutheran alliance which had failed, and not exactly similar to
the union with Cleves which had just been completed. It was far more cautious and
non-committal than either of them, and it was for this reason that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Henry liked it. In the first place, Philip was a Catholic, so that an agreement with
him involved no contradiction to the doctrines proclaimed in the Six Articles. In
the second place, he was ostensibly a close ally of the Emperor’s and a member of
the Imperial Order of the Golden Fleece<a id="FNanchor_667_667"/><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>,
though, as we have seen, the ingratitude of Charles after his services in Germany
must necessarily have tended to make their relations less cordial. Henry was
doubtless accurately informed of all this, and saw in an agreement with a member
of this powerful though vacillating Wittelsbach family, an opportunity to gain
valuable aid in case he were really attacked, without ostensibly committing
himself to a policy which would at any time prevent a return to cordial relations
with France and Spain. In the next chapter we shall see that it was precisely
during Philip’s visit at the English Court that Henry’s hopes of staving off the
dreaded coalition of Charles and Francis against him were once more revived in a
most unexpected way. The terms of the agreement which he attempted to conclude with
the Duke may thus be regarded as the first intimation of the complete reversal of
England’s foreign policy which was witnessed by the first six months of the year
1540. According to the draft of a treaty drawn up in England to be presented to
Philip for his approval, the Duke was to send to the King’s assistance the number
of —— horse and foot if Henry was attacked by any prince or private person, and
was further to aid the King if he made war for the recovery of any right of which
he was defrauded<a id="FNanchor_668_668"/><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a>.
We unfortunately do not possess the original copy of the treaty signed on January
24, but in an account of Philip’s life by his brother Ottheinrich, it appears that
the final agreement was that the Duke should furnish the King with 1,000 horsemen
and 4,000 foot-soldiers against everyone except the Roman Empire<a id="FNanchor_669_669"/><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a>.
The exception of the ‘Roman Empire,’ which was probably introduced at Philip’s
request,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span> was a provision of
so vague a nature that it could not bind either party very strictly; it certainly
could not have applied to a coalition of Charles and Francis, which was all that
Henry wanted, and it had the additional advantage that it made it appear that the
compact was not especially directed against the Emperor, and so could not be
resented by him. On the subject of the Pope and the illegitimacy of Mary, the King,
as we have seen, had remained firm: to yield to Philip on these two points would
simply have been to stultify all the work of the previous ten years, a step which
Henry, even in the gravest peril, was not prepared to take. But the other terms of
the agreement were precisely to his taste. The new treaty could be very useful if
the crisis came, and yet it was so arranged that with his well-known ability for
quibbling, the King could easily throw it over, if his hopes of a change for the
better in his relations with France and Spain were actually fulfilled. It thus stands
out in sharp contrast to the Lutheran alliance which Cromwell had advocated, and
which, if it had been accomplished, would have irrevocably committed England to
permanent hostility to Charles. The terms of the treaty with Philip were cautious,
carefully guarded, and strictly non-committal; the Lutheran alliance, had it been
carried through, would have been rash, definite, and irrevocable. The contrast
between the two schemes is the contrast between the policies of Henry and Cromwell.
Though the treaty with Philip was never ratified and the agreement which it proposed
was thus never destined to succeed, the fact that so many efforts were made to
accomplish it at the very moment that the negotiations with the Lutherans, of which
Cromwell had been the chief supporter, were finally abandoned, is very significant
in revealing the relative positions of King and minister at the opening of the year
1540.</p>

<p>Briefly to review the state of affairs at this critical juncture. The dread of
an attack by the joint forces of France and Spain, which had hung over England for
more than a year, seemed to call for a defensive league with some outside power.
But even in this hour of national peril the King did not forget the lesson that he
had learned at Wolsey’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
fall: he remembered that the situation on the Continent had often changed before
and was likely to do so again, and therefore in his search for a foreign alliance
he took the greatest pains to keep his hand free. Cromwell, on the contrary, was
now too far advanced in the policy he had followed since the summer of 1538 to be
able to retreat from it, though the warning conveyed by the reaction of June, 1539
had certainly opened his eyes to the dangers of the course he pursued. But it was
in vain that he attempted to persuade his master to sanction an alliance with the
Lutherans. Henry refused to consent to any move which would bind him as permanently
as this. Instead the King directed his efforts towards concluding an agreement of
a very different nature with Duke Philip of Bavaria, but his demands were so great
that this scheme also failed, owing to the unwillingness of the other members of
the Wittelsbach family to ratify the treaty. The only alliance which did materialize
was that with Cleves. It was a sort of compromise between the Lutheran and the
Bavarian plans; it committed England less definitely than the one, though more so
than the other. But the responsibility for it had been made to rest entirely on
Cromwell’s shoulders, and the minister must have realized that his safety depended
on its success. While it was under negotiation, the danger from France and Spain
seemed so threatening that the policy of Cromwell was apparently justified. Almost
at the moment of its completion, however, events took place which totally changed
the aspect of affairs, called for the abandonment of the alliance with Cleves, and
led to the ruin of the man whose fortunes were identified with it. What these events
were will be seen in the succeeding chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE FALL OF THOMAS CROMWELL</p>

<p>While Henry and Cromwell had been occupied in negotiations with various German
princes, the Emperor and the French King had not been idle. Every day seemed to
bring some fresh confirmation of the unwelcome news that the two monarchs were
again on the most friendly terms. By the middle of December the anxiety of England
reached the highest pitch, for the report came that Francis and Charles had actually
met at Loches, and that their first interview had been marked by every demonstration
of cordiality<a id="FNanchor_677_677"/><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>.
The French King accompanied the Emperor on his journey northward, and on New Year’s
Day they entered Paris together amid great rejoicing. For eight days the Louvre
saw a succession of balls, fêtes, and jousts. It is said that Jean Cousin was
ordered to make a bust of the Emperor<a id="FNanchor_678_678"/><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>.</p>

<p>But if the meeting of Charles and Francis and their apparently perfect amity
were the cause of profound alarm in England, the proximity of the two rivals furnished
at the same time an admirable opportunity for a last attempt to stir up jealousy
between them. The King, who as we have seen had never even in his most anxious
moments abandoned the hope of fomenting discord between the two sovereigns, was
not the man to permit this chance to escape him. Sir Thomas Wyatt, who had been
recalled from Spain a short time before, was now sent back to Paris to co-operate
with Bonner, the ambassador to France, in the endeavour to make use of the situation
for Henry’s purposes<a id="FNanchor_679_679"/><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a>.
His instructions to express the King’s joy at the prospect of a renewal of amity
between Francis and Charles were of course merely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
a blind to cover his real intentions. It was not long before the character of the
latter was made plainly evident. Wyatt wrote a full account of his proceedings to
Henry on January 7, 1540<a id="FNanchor_680_680"/><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a>.
In his letter he did not say whether he paid any attention to the written instructions
which the King had previously given him or not, but reported his endeavours to
obtain the arrest of one Brancetour, an Englishman in the Emperor’s train, whom
the Act of Attainder of 1539 had condemned. From Wyatt’s account, however, it
appears that the actual taking of Brancetour was a matter of secondary importance,
compared to the possibility it opened of stirring up a quarrel between Francis and
Charles. The two ambassadors had waited upon the French King, and had readily obtained
his consent to the arrest. Brancetour was taken, but insisted that he acknowledged
no master except the Emperor, and was consequently not amenable to English law. He
applied to Charles, who of course refused to give his servant up; the matter was
again brought before the French King, who, being far more anxious to secure the
good will of the Emperor than that of Henry, gave orders for the prisoner’s release.
At first it seemed as if the efforts of the two ambassadors had merely resulted in
drawing Charles and Francis closer together. Chagrined at the failure of his efforts,
Bonner had made matters worse by rudely remonstrating with the French King for
permitting Brancetour to be restored to liberty. The chief result of this proceeding
was that the English ambassador became so generally hated at the French Court on
account of his bluntness and discourtesy, that Henry felt obliged to recall him in
favour of Sir John Wallop<a id="FNanchor_681_681"/><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a>.</p>

<p>With the ground cleared by the retirement of his unpopular colleague, Sir Thomas
Wyatt was able to display to far greater advantage that wealth of tact and diplomatic
talent, which had rendered him such an invaluable servant to Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
at the Emperor’s Court. He immediately saw that it was useless to blame Francis,
as Bonner had done, for an act which the situation had forced upon him, and he
forbore to mention the affair of Brancetour again in the presence of the French
King. Instead he addressed himself to Charles, and in the most careful and guarded
phrases insinuated that the Emperor had shown ingratitude to Henry, in obtaining
the Englishman’s release<a id="FNanchor_682_682"/><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>.
Wyatt’s action throughout was characterized by an external courtesy quite as
remarkable as the previous rudeness of Bonner, and his efforts were finally
rewarded in a manner which exceeded the King’s highest expectations. He had caught
the Emperor off his guard, and the first result of his representations was to
cause the usually imperturbable Charles completely to lose his temper. The Emperor
in his vexation let several words escape him, of which Wyatt was prompt to take
advantage. When reproached with ingratitude, Charles had turned sharply on the
ambassador with a few angry words, which implied that it was impossible for him to
be ‘ingrate’ to Henry, on account of the superiority of his own Imperial rank. The
Emperor confessed that ‘the inferyour’ might be ‘ingrate to the greter,’ though
the term was ‘skant sufferable bytwene lyke<a id="FNanchor_683_683"/><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>,’
but hinted that an accusation of ingratitude from the petty King of England against
himself, the acknowledged head of Christendom, was entirely out of place. All this
was reported at the English Court in early February. The use which Henry made of
the information is remarkable. As a result of Wyatt’s communications, the Duke of
Norfolk was sent with a special message to Francis<a id="FNanchor_684_684"/><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a>.
He was ordered to quote all the conversation between Charles and Wyatt, but so to
distort the meaning of the Emperor’s angry words as to make it appear that Charles
was using Francis’ friendship merely as a stepping-stone to an ulterior purpose,
and perhaps to a plan for the domination of Europe. Charles’ unfortunate slip about
superiors and inferiors lent itself well to such an interpretation. On February 15
the Duke arrived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span> at the
French Court, of which Charles had already taken leave, and was immediately received
by Francis<a id="FNanchor_685_685"/><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a>.
From Norfolk’s own report it is evident that he had at last succeeded in creating
serious distrust of the Emperor in the mind of the French King, and he reported to
Henry that by Francis’ countenance he ‘dyd conjecte He was not content with
thEmperours wordes<a id="FNanchor_686_686"/><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>.’</p>

<p>Of course the intrigues of Norfolk and Wyatt were only one of a number
of things which contributed to cause the quarrel between Charles and
Francis to break out afresh. The ground had been pretty well prepared for
it by a series of petty but annoying occurrences, which had taken place
during the Emperor’s visit<a id="FNanchor_687_687"/><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a>,
and the efforts of the English ambassadors were substantially aided by
Charles’ flat refusal to fulfil his promises to Francis about the Low
Countries and Milan, after the subjugation of the revolt in Ghent had
once more left him a free hand. But the part which England played in
accelerating the rupture was in itself by no means inconsiderable, and it
is of the most vital importance for our purposes here, to notice that the
name of Cromwell scarcely appears once in connexion with it. It is true
that after Norfolk had succeeded in driving in the first wedge which
started the breach between Charles and Francis, the King’s minister wrote
two letters to Wallop<a id="FNanchor_688_688"/><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>,
directing him to follow up the advantage already gained, but they were
evidently dictated by Henry, and seem to have been a necessity forced
upon Cromwell by the action of his rival. The fact was that Cromwell’s
identification with the German alliance had cut him off from bearing a
hand in any other part of the foreign policy, and that his place as a
negotiator with France and Spain had been usurped by his bitterest enemy,
the Duke of Norfolk. The latter’s success at the French Court had proved
that the policy to which the King had always pinned his faith, in opposition
to Cromwell’s advocacy of an outside alliance, had not lost all its
efficacy, and the rapidly widening breach between Charles and Francis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
showed that the league with Cleves was not indispensable for England’s
safety. More than this, it now looked as if the treaty with Duke William,
far from being an advantage, would become a positive burden. Cromwell had
sought the alliance in the hope of gaining valuable aid in case England
was attacked: it had not occurred to him that some day the positions might
be reversed, and that England might be expected to give aid, rather than
to receive it. The fact that Charles, instead of planning an invasion of
England with Francis, had gone straight from Paris to the Low
Countries<a id="FNanchor_689_689"/><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a>
and did not disguise his intention of regaining Gelderland, rendered this
disagreeable turn of affairs distinctly probable. Worst of all, the King’s
disgust for Anne of Cleves had increased so rapidly, that it was useless
to attempt to conceal it. Henry might pardon a political blunder alone,
but when combined with a matrimonial misfortune, it was more difficult to
forgive. Everything seemed to unite to call for a reversal of the Cromwellian
policy. The King’s minister had abandoned as hopeless a scheme which his
rival had been able to show was still feasible; he had sought a cure
before he was certain that prevention was impossible: the cure he had
prescribed, besides being unnecessary, had actually proved dangerous, and
lastly, the matrimonial alliance which formed the basis of it had turned
out a complete failure.</p>

<p>It was certainly the most favourable opportunity that had yet presented
itself for Cromwell’s enemies to compass his ruin, and Norfolk and Gardiner,
the most inveterate of his foes, were not slow to realize it. The latter,
ever since his recall from France in 1538, had used every effort to
undermine the influence of the man who had stepped into the place which
he had coveted for himself at Wolsey’s fall. In alliance with Norfolk,
who returned from his errand to the French King in March, 1540, he now
succeeded in gathering to himself all the influential persons at the
English Court who desired the downfall of their plebeian rival. It did
not take very long to discover that Henry was ready to abandon Cromwell,
and as soon as his enemies were certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
of this fact, they saw that all that was necessary for the accomplishment
of their designs was to devise a pretext for the minister’s destruction,
more plausible than an accusation of advocating a useless alliance and an
unfortunate marriage. So faithfully had Cromwell served the King’s interests,
however, that at first it seemed almost impossible to find such a pretext,
but the astute Gardiner was soon able to discover the one weak spot in
his rival’s armour. It is hardly necessary to state what this was. The
only occasions on which Henry and Cromwell had been brought into collision
were disputes over questions of foreign policy, and the Bishop of Winchester
saw that the minister’s reputation as advocate of an alliance with the
Lutherans in opposition to the King’s wishes, furnished the basis for a
charge of supporting their religious principles in defiance of the doctrines
proclaimed in the Six Articles. No accusation against Cromwell could have
been more unjust than this. We have seen that the minister himself had
abandoned the Lutherans by this time; moreover even in the days when he
had urged an alliance with them, he had never made the least concession
to their religious tendencies. We call to mind at once the significant
words that he had spoken to Baumbach in the previous January, when he had
declared that his theological beliefs were identical with those of the
King. Cromwell’s religion had always been dictated by political expediency;
he certainly had no sympathy for Protestant theology in itself, or indeed
for theology of any kind which did not lead to practical results. But
unfortunately the mass of the people were totally unable to see this fact,
and he was commonly looked upon as the greatest friend and helper that
the Protestants had. As opposition to the Pope had given him his political
greatness, the Reformers had flocked to him for protection when the Six
Articles were passed, and their trust in him was further strengthened by
the inferences which they drew from his foreign policy. The Bishop of
Winchester was perfectly well aware of the actual state of affairs, and
also of the gross misconception of Cromwell’s true theological position
which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> existed in
the minds of the people. If he could only catch his rival in some definite
act which would justify a distinct accusation of opposing the King in
matters of religion, he saw that the ground was already well prepared for
the success of his plot. The opportunity which he sought was soon to present
itself.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that in the early part of the year 1539 Henry
had sent Dr. Barnes to Germany to conciliate the King of Denmark and the
Elector of Saxony. At the news of the passage of the Six Articles, which
of course stultified all his efforts, Barnes had come back to England,
profoundly disgusted at the King’s vacillating policy. Henry felt so
certain of his ground at the time of his ambassador’s return, that in
spite of the requests of Cromwell, he contemptuously refused to grant him
a hearing<a id="FNanchor_690_690"/><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a>.
The King’s minister was either unable or unwilling to take the hint,
which his master had given him, that Barnes was no longer in favour, and
he was rash enough to attempt to console the envoy for the ill-success of
his mission, by promoting him to the prebend of Lanbedye<a id="FNanchor_691_691"/><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a>.
Cromwell had thus played into his enemy’s hand by an action which lent
itself to the precise interpretation which Gardiner was seeking. It was
now an easy matter to hold the minister responsible for any rash act which
his protégé might commit, and Barnes, who was one of the very extreme Lutherans,
did not take long to fulfil the hopes which the Bishop of Winchester had
entertained of his recklessness. He was foolish enough to take violent
exception to a sermon which Gardiner had preached at Paul’s Cross, in
which the latter had denounced certain Protestant doctrines. Preaching in
the same pulpit two weeks later on the same text, Barnes denied all that
Gardiner had said, insulted him openly, and finally threw down his glove
to the people, as a defiance against the Bishop<a id="FNanchor_692_692"/><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a>.
Barnes had doubtless presumed on Cromwell’s protection to support him in
this tirade, for it seems that the year before, when his position had
been much stronger, the King’s minister had successfully defended his
friend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> against a
charge of heresy by Gardiner, and had actually been able to remove the
latter from the Privy Council in revenge for his attack on the Lutheran<a id="FNanchor_693_693"/><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>.
But this time Barnes had gone too far, and Cromwell, whose influence was
by no means what it had been, was unable to save him again. The Bishop of
Winchester complained to the King, who was scandalized, and ordered
Barnes to be examined before him; the Lutheran was utterly worsted in a
theological discussion; he was forced to recant and beg Gardiner’s pardon.
This he did with such ill grace and so many contradictions that he was
arrested and placed in the Tower with the others who had supported him.</p>

<p>All this happened in the last week of March. It was perfectly obvious
to those who had any real knowledge of the trend things were taking, that
Gardiner had made his complaint far more with the idea of harming Cromwell,
than of injuring Barnes himself, and the fact that the minister had not
been able to rescue his friend a second time led many to predict his speedy
downfall<a id="FNanchor_694_694"/><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>.
But Cromwell managed to stave off the ultimately inevitable catastrophe
for two months more, and to maintain his ascendancy until the end of May.
He certainly had no delusions as to the gravity of the situation in which
he found himself, and he fully realized that his best chance of safety
lay in making a humble acknowledgement of his error in favouring the Lutheran
preacher. Though there is no actual record that he apologized to the
Bishop of Winchester, there is every internal evidence of it. That at
least a temporary reconciliation took place between him and Gardiner is
proved by a letter of Sir John Wallop which informs us that on March 30
the Bishop of Winchester dined at London with the Lord Privy Seal, and
that they ‘were more than iiij hour<i>es</i> and opened theyre hart<i>es</i>
and so concluded that and therbe truthe or honesty in them not only all
displeasures be forgotton, but also in thayre hert<i>es</i> be now perfight
intier frend<i>es</i><a id="FNanchor_695_695"/><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>.’
It would have been hardly possible to bring about even a temporary truce
between these two men without an apology on one side or the other, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
it is not likely that Gardiner, backed as he was by the King, would have
been the one to make it. In order to maintain his very precarious position,
Cromwell had been forced to grovel before a man, whom two years before he
could have ordered about to his heart’s content.</p>

<p>But it had been one of the greatest secrets of Cromwell’s success that
he had never been too proud to take any step, however humiliating, which
he deemed necessary for his profit or safety. Nevertheless it is doubtful
if his apology to the Bishop of Winchester, unaided by any outside
occurrence, would have been sufficient to prevent his immediate overthrow.
The month of April, however, saw two events, one at home and the other
abroad, which further raised his hopes and encouraged him to renewed efforts
to regain his influence. The first of these was the assemblage of Parliament,
an occasion on which Cromwell had always been able to make himself
particularly useful to the King. He was not slow to realize the opportunity
that was offered him, and he laboured with all his might for the passage
of the measures which he knew his master desired. He made an opening
speech in the House of Lords, in which he said that the King wished
concord above all things and desired to suppress all dissension concerning
religious doctrines: and he emphasized his words by providing for the
appointment of a commission to correct all abuses and enforce respect for
the Scriptures<a id="FNanchor_696_696"/><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>.
What was accomplished in this direct endeavour to extirpate heresy is
less important than a move of a more practical nature, which bears every
evidence of being planned by Cromwell. The ancient military and religious
order of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem was the sole remaining
stronghold of monasticism in England that had been suffered to escape the
onslaught of the King’s minister. To complete the work of destruction
which he had begun their downfall was essential, and an Act to abolish
them and confiscate their property finally passed both Houses after a
prolonged debate<a id="FNanchor_697_697"/><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>.
A complicated Taxation Bill, which was carried through at the same time,
seemed also to bear the stamp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of Cromwellian genius. Such services to the Crown had not been suffered
to go unrewarded, for on April 18 those who had prophesied the ruin of
the King’s minister were amazed by his being created Earl of Essex and
Great Chamberlain of England<a id="FNanchor_698_698"/><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>.
The French ambassador, who only seven days before had reported to Francis
that Cromwell was tottering to his fall, now confessed that the new-made
Earl ‘was in as much credit with the King as ever he was, from which he
was near being shaken by the Bishop of Winchester and others.’</p>

<p>The other event which gave Cromwell a momentary ray of hope was the
arrival of a piece of news from France, which at first looked like a
vindication of his foreign policy as against that of the King. Early in
April it was rumoured in London that the French were fortifying Ardres,
and the King’s minister wrote a letter to Wallop on the twelfth instructing
him to demand an explanation from Francis<a id="FNanchor_699_699"/><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a>,
who (according to the ambassador’s report) replied that ‘He knewe not but
that He myght aswell buyld there or fortefye uppon his borders as the
Kinges Highnes dothe at Callais, Guysnes, and other his fortresses<a id="FNanchor_700_700"/><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a>.’
These words, though spoken ‘very gently and nothing in collour,’ appear
to have caused profound anxiety at the English Court, and Henry’s faith
in the success of his plans of fomenting discord between Charles and
Francis received a rude shock. Everything which tended to justify the
alliance with Cleves as a defensive measure was of course welcome news to
Cromwell, who privately must have been as much encouraged by the messages
from France as others were dismayed by them. But the satisfaction which
he derived from the report of the fortifications at Ardres was only of
short duration. There were no further hostile developments for the present,
and an announcement was soon received from the Netherlands which offered
reasons for the abandonment of the alliance with Cleves far more cogent
than those which the news from France furnished for its continuance. It
was reported that the Emperor, immediately after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
the subjugation of the revolt of Ghent, had repeated his demands for the
cession of Gelderland<a id="FNanchor_701_701"/><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a>
by Duke William, and there seemed every probability that in case of
refusal he would enforce them by the sword. The bearing of this move on
the alliance of England with Cleves has been already indicated. We have
seen that when Charles first turned his steps from Paris to the Low Countries,
Cromwell probably realized for the first time that the league on which he
had based all his hopes might actually work to England’s disadvantage,
and that Cleves might be the sole gainer from it. The news from the
Netherlands was virtually a confirmation of the minister’s gravest fears.
The prospect that he would soon be called upon to defend an ally whom he
had expected to defend him, and for whom he had no real regard, must have
been intolerable to Henry, and the state of his relations to Anne of
Cleves at the time tended of course to increase rather than to diminish
his vexation. Add to this the fact that tidings of a somewhat disquieting
nature kept coming in from Scotland and Ireland, the blame for which
could easily be made to fall on Cromwell, and one can well believe that
any gains the King’s minister may have made in the Parliament which had
met in April were more than counterbalanced by the losses he had sustained
in the course of affairs abroad. Norfolk and Gardiner probably siezed
this favourable opportunity to weave further plots against their hated
rival, and to devise fresh measures to poison the King’s ear against
him<a id="FNanchor_702_702"/><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a>.
But even had the enmity of these men been turned into friendship, Cromwell’s
political blunders had got him into a position from which nothing could
extricate him. He had incurred the enmity of a master who never forgave,
and his ultimate ruin could only be a question of time.</p>

<p>The events of the month of May were but foreshadowings of the end. On
the ninth the King summoned Cromwell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to a council, at which the definite abandonment of the minister’s policy
must have been openly discussed<a id="FNanchor_703_703"/><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>.
Records of the conference are not preserved to us, but the result of it
was that two days later Cromwell was forced much against his will to
write a letter to Pate, the new ambassador to the Emperor, directing him
to take steps to conciliate Charles and hinting that the alliance with
Cleves might be thrown over at any moment<a id="FNanchor_704_704"/><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a>.
The latter part of the month brought with it further confirmation of the
minister’s impending fate. Duke William had sent ambassadors to the
English Court, to ask the advice of his powerful ally in regard to the
answer he should give to the Emperor’s demands for the cession of Gelderland.
Henry treated the envoys with marked coldness, and replied to their
requests in the most non-committal manner: he could do nothing for the
Duke of Cleves, he said, until he had more explicit information concerning
the rights and wrongs of the case<a id="FNanchor_705_705"/><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>.
The ground on which Cromwell’s feet rested was being cut away on all
sides, and yet Marillac, in a letter of the first of June, seemed to
think that the arrest of Dr. Wilson for having ‘Popish leanings’ was an
indication that the minister and his few remaining adherents still retained
some influence. He acknowledged, however, that things changed so rapidly
that no person could tell what was going to happen, only he was certain
that one party or the other must presently succumb<a id="FNanchor_706_706"/><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>.</p>

<p>The catastrophe came like a thunderbolt, less than two weeks after
Marillac had written this letter. An entry in the Journal of the House of
Lords on June 10 reads: ‘Hodie Vicegerens Regius <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> Comes Essex in
hora pomeridiana per Dominum Cancellarium et alios Dominos in Arcano
Domini Nostri Regis Consilio, ex Palatio Regio Domini Regis <i>Westm.</i>
hora tertia pomeridiana super Accusationem Criminis lese Majestatis
missus est in Arcem <i>Londinens</i><a id="FNanchor_707_707"/><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a>.’
This bald statement is confirmed by letters from Marillac to Francis and
Montmorency at the time<a id="FNanchor_708_708"/><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>,
but a much more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
striking account of the arrest is contained in another letter from the
French ambassador to the Constable, written two weeks later. It tells us
that ‘as soon as the Captain of the Guard declared his charge to make him
prisoner, Cromwell in a rage cast his bonnet on the ground, saying to the
Duke of Norfolk and others of the Privy Council assembled there, that
this was the reward of his services, and that he appealed to their
consciences as to whether he was a traitor: but since he was treated thus
he renounced all pardon, as he had never thought to have offended, and
only asked the King not to make him languish long. Thereupon some said he
was a traitor, others that he should be judged according to the laws he
had made, which were so sanguinary that often words spoken inadvertently
with good intention had been constituted high treason. The Duke of Norfolk,
having reproached him with some “villennyes” done by him, snatched off
the order of St. George, which he bore on his neck, and the Admiral, to
show himself as great an enemy in adversity as he had been thought a
friend in prosperity, untied the Garter. Then by a door which opens upon
the water, he was put in a boat and taken to the Tower, without the
people of this town suspecting it, until they saw all the King’s archers
under Mr. Cheyney at the door of the suspected prisoner’s house, where
they made an inventory of his goods which were not of such value as people
thought, although too much for a “compaignon de telle estoffe.” The money
was £7,000, equal to 28,000 crs., and the silver plate, including crosses,
chalices, and other spoils of the Church, might be as much more. These
moveables were before night taken to the King’s treasury, a sign that
they will not be restored<a id="FNanchor_709_709"/><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>.’</p>

<p>On the day of the arrest, a royal messenger was sent to the French
ambassador, to tell him that he must not be amazed at what had happened,
for though common ignorant people spoke of it ‘variously,’ the King said
that he was determined that Marillac should know the truth. Henry stated
that while he was trying ‘by all possible means to lead back religion to
the way of truth, Cromwell, as attached to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
German Lutherans, had always favoured the doctors who preached such
erroneous opinions, and hindered those who preached the contrary, and
that recently warned by some of his principal servants to reflect that he
was working against the intention of the King and of the Acts of Parliament,
he had betrayed himself and said he hoped to suppress the old preachers
and have only the new, adding that the affair would soon be brought to
such a pass that the King with all his power could not prevent it, but
rather his own party would be so strong that he would make the King
descend to the new doctrines even if he had to take arms against him<a id="FNanchor_710_710"/><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>.’
From this and from another letter written by the council to Wallop at
the same time<a id="FNanchor_711_711"/><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
it appears that the King had been able to devise no more plausible
pretext for the destruction of his minister than that which had been
suggested by the Bishop of Winchester, a pretext which as we have seen
was false and unjust in every respect, but convenient in many ways,
especially as it was sure to win the approval of the mass of the people,
who looked upon Cromwell as a true Protestant and hated him as such, not
being able to see that it was solely owing to political motives, that he
had been connected with the Reformers<a id="FNanchor_712_712"/><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>.
But the fact that the charge on which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
he was convicted was totally unjustifiable does not in any way imply that
Cromwell was wrongly condemned. There were other perfectly valid reasons
for his punishment, which, however, it was quite impossible to bring
forward against him, simply because the King had shared his guilt. If the
number of innocent persons, whom the minister’s influence had brought to
the block, be not a sufficient warrant for his conviction and execution,
it would be difficult to find a character in English history who merited
the death penalty. But all these crimes could not be laid to his charge
because the King had supported him in them, and he was arrested instead
on the false accusation of opposition to the master to whose service he
had devoted his life.</p>

<p>Cranmer was the only man who dared to say a word to the King on Cromwell’s
behalf. He wrote a pathetic letter to Henry the day after the arrest,
expressing his wonder and distress that one whom he had deemed so good
and so faithful, should be accused of treason, but in vain<a id="FNanchor_713_713"/><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>.
The fallen minister was not even permitted a trial in which he could be
heard in his own defence. That terrible engine of extra-legal destruction,
the attainder, by which so many of his own enemies had been annihilated,
was used as a swifter and surer means to bring him to the block. The Act
of Parliament which attainted him was read in the House of Lords just one
week after his arrest<a id="FNanchor_714_714"/><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>:
it simply enumerated various acts and speeches which had been laid to his
charge, as indicating that he had plotted to make himself more powerful
than the King in matters both religious and political, and stated that he
had thus incurred the charge of high treason, for which he was condemned
to die. He was to suffer as a heretic or a traitor at the King’s pleasure,
and forfeit all property held since<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
March 31, 1538. That Cromwell was deprived of all titles and prerogatives
on the day of his arrest, and was called only ‘Thomas Cromwell, shearman,’
and that his servants were forbidden to wear his livery, led Marillac to
think that he would not be beheaded, as befitted a lord, but would be
‘dragged up as an ignoble person, and afterwards hanged and quartered<a id="FNanchor_715_715"/><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a>.’
This impression was current two weeks later, for Norfolk told Marillac on
July 6, that Cromwell’s end would be ‘the most ignominious in use in the
country<a id="FNanchor_716_716"/><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a>.’
It was not until the day of his execution that ‘grace was made to him
upon the method of his death,’ and beheading was substituted for a more
painful and ignominious penalty<a id="FNanchor_717_717"/><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>.
For though his arrest had been immediately followed by his attainder,
execution was delayed for six weeks more, in order that the King might
make use of him for a last time, to gain an end which Cromwell had successfully
secured for him once before, namely a divorce from a hated Queen.</p>

<p>From the day of his arrest, his execution had been a foregone conclusion;
there was no chance of ultimate salvation for the fallen minister. But as
a drowning man clutches at a straw to save himself from death, so Cromwell,
at Henry’s request, wrote a letter, which he must have known would be useless,
to say what he could on his own behalf<a id="FNanchor_718_718"/><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>.
The letter speaks for itself: its denials of the charges are not as frequent
as the acknowledgements of guilt and pleas for mercy, but it produced no
effect on the angry King. What the injudicious words spoken before Throgmorton
and Riche were, it is impossible to tell; they were probably simply sentences
into which a treasonable intent was read, as into those mentioned in the
attainder; the ‘secrete matier’ which Cromwell was accused of revealing
without leave may well have been a project of Henry’s to get rid of Anne,
which for many reasons it was expedient for him to keep secret, until he
was certain that he could free himself by one blow from the marriage which
by this time had become intolerable to him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
To this purpose all the King’s energies were now bent, and conscious that
his fallen minister had known more of his relations with Anne than any
other, he sent him in the end of June a list of questions on the subject,
couched in such judicious language, that if Cromwell gave the replies he
confidently looked for, they would supply cogent reasons for his
divorce<a id="FNanchor_719_719"/><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>.
He was sure, he said, that now that Cromwell was condemned to die, he
would tell the truth and not damn his soul also, by bearing false witness
at the last<a id="FNanchor_720_720"/><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>.
Whether Henry’s assumption here was correct or not, it is impossible to
tell. Cromwell knew of course that his chance of pardon was almost nothing,
but he was not so foolish as to throw it away absolutely; he also knew
that the King’s heart’s desire was a divorce from Anne, and he saw that
his only hope lay in aiding Henry to his utmost to free himself from her.
Nor was Cromwell the sort of man to whom dying with a lie on his lips
would mean very much; his whole interest was absorbed in the endeavour to
make the most of the one very faint chance of escape that was offered to
him. Hence it is possible that the testimony he bore in this case may not
have been strictly true. He appears to have written two letters in answer
to the King’s interrogatories; one of them is in the library of the
Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House; the other, badly mutilated, in
the British Museum<a id="FNanchor_721_721"/><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>.
Both of them are filled with abject pleas for mercy, and one of them,
which was carried to the King by Cromwell’s faithful Ralph Sadler, moved
Henry so much, that it is said that he commanded it to be read to him
thrice<a id="FNanchor_722_722"/><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a>.
The two letters tell the same story in slightly different words: they
give a full account of everything that Cromwell had seen of Henry’s
relation to Anne, since they first met at Rochester. They dilate on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
King’s disgust at the first sight of the ‘great Flanders mare,’ tell how
he endeavoured to put off the wedding, alleging as his excuse the previous
engagement of Anne and the Duke of Lorraine’s son, and finally quote a
conversation of Henry and Cromwell, the day after the marriage, in which
the King appears to have informed his minister that consummation had not
followed. The truth of this last statement is apparently corroborated by
a letter which Anne sent to her brother a few days later<a id="FNanchor_723_723"/><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>.
Experience of the very unscrupulous methods of Henry VIII., especially
when matrimonial issues were at stake, leads the reader, however, at least
to recognize the possibility that Anne may have written this letter under
compulsion and the threat of death if she refused. The testimony with
which the King had armed himself for the struggle he anticipated over
gaining a divorce from his fourth wife, was thus all of it obtained under
circumstances that certainly cast grave suspicions on its veracity; and
the modern student may well be excused for refusing to accept it with that
pleasingly implicit faith which the Convocations and Parliaments of this
period almost invariably placed in the statements of the sovereign<a id="FNanchor_724_724"/><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a>.</p>

<p>Certainly there was little cause for Henry to doubt his own ability to
wrest a decision of the nullity of his marriage from clergy, Lords, and
Commons. Ten years of Cromwell’s masterfulness had been enough to convince
them of the absolute futility of opposing the King in any matter on which
he had set his heart. The evidence wrung from the fallen minister almost
under the shadow of the scaffold, and the confirmatory letter elicited
from Anne, coupled with a ‘breve trew and parfaict declarac<i>i</i>on’
from the King himself<a id="FNanchor_725_725"/><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>,
were quite sufficient to cause Convocation after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
three days of debate finally to agree on the judgement that the union was
unlawful, and to send their decision to Parliament on July 12. An Act to
proclaim the marriage null and void from the beginning was hurried through
the Houses with all possible speed, and on the 14th it was passed<a id="FNanchor_726_726"/><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>.
From that time onward the ‘lady Anne was treated as a sister by the King’;
she was suffered to live in retirement, adequate lands and money were
apportioned to her, and she remained in England, contented and happy that
execution had not been substituted for divorce<a id="FNanchor_727_727"/><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>.
The Duke of Cleves was naturally enraged at the treatment of his sister,
and resolutely refused to acknowledge that she had been honourably dealt
with; but he knew that he was too weak to avenge the insult, and coldly
promised that the nullification of the marriage would not cause him to
‘departe from his devotion leage and amytie’ with the King of England<a id="FNanchor_728_728"/><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a>.</p>

<p>The story of Cromwell’s arrest, followed by the report of the divorce
of Anne of Cleves, was also immediately communicated to France and Spain.
Francis appears to have received the news of the first with unfeigned joy,
and was not slow to signify to Henry his satisfaction at the unexpected
turn of affairs<a id="FNanchor_729_729"/><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a>.
He wrote again to the King a little later, asserting that Cromwell had
adjusted a dispute over some prizes taken by the ships of the governor of
Picardy, the Sieur de Rochepot, in such a way that he had derived personal
gain from the transaction; this complaint was sent to Cromwell in the
Tower, and drew from him the reply contained in the last existing letter
which he wrote<a id="FNanchor_730_730"/><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a>.
Francis’ enthusiasm at the ruin of a minister whom he had such reason to
hate, seems to have been somewhat diminished when he learned that Anne’s
marriage had been dissolved, as he naturally saw that this step would
immediately put England and Spain on a better footing. An interesting
account of the ambassador Carne’s breaking the news to Francis, is given
in a letter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
Wallop’s to Henry of July 10. Francis, as it appears, ‘fett a gret sighte,’
as if reflecting on the vacillating methods of his ‘nere and dere brother,’
but finally assented that Henry’s ‘owne conscience shuld be judge
therein<a id="FNanchor_731_731"/><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a>.’
The French King, though he greatly rejoiced in Cromwell’s fall, was
evidently somewhat taken aback by the first result of the consummation of
his hopes. Charles showed none of the same outward enthusiasm, when Pate
declared to him the news of Cromwell’s arrest; he did not even send a
message, but left the ambassador in a later letter to the King to supplement
his silence with his own approval. His replies to the news of the divorce
of Anne were likewise calm, but he certainly was much relieved by what he
had heard<a id="FNanchor_732_732"/><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a>.
The common opinion which the sudden reversal of Cromwell’s policy had
caused on the Continent seems to have been, as Pate wrote to Norfolk on
July 31, that Henry had ‘lost the hartes of the Electors of thEmpire’ but
had ‘contravailed thEmprour or the Frenche King in there places<a id="FNanchor_733_733"/><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a>.’</p>

<p>On July 27 the Parliament closed, having finished the work that the
King had mapped out for it. Since Cromwell’s arrest it had practically
undone all that his foreign policy of the two past years had accomplished,
by nullifying the marriage of Henry and Anne. The rest of its proceedings
are unimportant, except perhaps the attainder of Barnes, Garret, and
Jerome, the Lutheran preachers, who were convicted of heresy and sentenced
to die at the stake<a id="FNanchor_734_734"/><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>.
With the divorce from Anne secured, and those whom the minister had
favoured at home condemned, there was now no longer any impediment to the
completion of the final act of the tragedy, and on July 28 ‘Thomas Cromwell,
shearman,’ was led forth to execution. In a letter to Francis, Marillac
simply mentions the fact of his death<a id="FNanchor_735_735"/><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a>,
but a more complete account of the end of the great minister is fortunately
preserved to us in the chronicles of Holinshed and Hall, and the history
of Foxe<a id="FNanchor_736_736"/><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[301]</a></p>

<p>From the stories of all these chroniclers it appears that Cromwell on
the scaffold made an address to the people, declaring the faith in which
he died. That his speech was printed and publicly circulated is attested
by Pole; and the fact that Holinshed, Hall, and Foxe give it in almost
exactly the same words corroborates the truth of the Cardinal’s statement.
Pole, however, goes on to say that though at first he accepted the printed
speech as a true version of Cromwell’s words, he later learned from
trustworthy persons that what Cromwell had actually said was something
very different<a id="FNanchor_737_737"/><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>.
The words of the speech certainly have the appearance of being composed
beforehand and forced upon Cromwell’s dying lips. He confessed that he
had done wrong, asked forgiveness of his King, and finally asserted that
he died in the Catholic Faith, not doubting in any article of his faith,
‘no nor doubting in any Sacrament of the Church<a id="FNanchor_738_738"/><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>.’
This last statement was certainly untrue; nor would it have been in any
way less false, if Cromwell had said that he died a true Protestant<a id="FNanchor_739_739"/><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a>.
His religious beliefs were, as far as can be discovered, absolutely
nothing when disconnected from practical ends, and he probably made his
last speech at the King’s command, either to save himself from a more
shameful death than beheading, or else, as is quite probable, to avert
the ruin of his son Gregory, who he perhaps feared would fall with him.
On this point, however, he need not have had any apprehension; Gregory
Cromwell, perhaps on account of his fortunate marriage with the aunt of
Prince Edward, appeared to be in as high favour as ever<a id="FNanchor_740_740"/><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>,
and the title of Baron Cromwell, which his father forfeited at his
attainder, was regranted to the young man by patent, Dec. 18, 1540<a id="FNanchor_741_741"/><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[302]</a></p>

<p>Besides this speech, which has given historians so much trouble, Hall
makes mention of the fact that Cromwell ‘made his praier, which was long,
but not so long as both Godly and learned<a id="FNanchor_742_742"/><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>.’
This prayer is given in full in Foxe, and, as it reads there, it certainly
justifies the use of the epithets that Hall applied to it<a id="FNanchor_743_743"/><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>.
Whether Foxe’s words were Cromwell’s words, or whether Cromwell’s words
were his own, and not those of the King which were given him to speak, is
however entirely another matter. It is unfortunate that we have no more
credible authority than the martyrologist on this point. Cromwell’s prayer,
as he gives it, was certainly that of a man who humbly acknowledged his
faults, and threw himself solely on the mercy of God; but the words which
he spoke are suspiciously devout, for those of a man to whom religion
mattered so little.</p>

<p>‘And thus,’ says Foxe, ‘his Prayer made, after he had godly and lovingly
exhorted them that were about him on the Scaffold, he quietly committed
his Soul into the hands of God, and so patiently suffered the stroke of
the Ax, by a ragged and butcherly Miser, which very ungodly performed his
Office<a id="FNanchor_744_744"/><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a>.’</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">THE WORK OF THOMAS CROMWELL</p>

<p>It is inevitable that there should be the widest divergence of opinion
concerning every great figure in Reformation history, and it is idle to
attempt to form an estimate of the character and work of Thomas Cromwell
that will satisfy those who take different views of the great struggle
during which his life was lived. But Catholics and Protestants must agree
on the fundamental and permanent nature of the changes which he wrought:
whether his work was good or bad, no one can deny his success in fulfilling
his life’s aim as declared to Cavendish on the All Hallows Day when he
rode forth to London ‘to make or to marre.’ He was the first chief
minister that England had ever had, who was base-born and yet not a
cleric. He stood completely outside the great religious movement of his
time, and only made use of it to further his own political ends. He came
at a time when things were in an unsettled state and ready for a change:
his personality, emotionless, practical, stern, impressed itself on every
phase of the national life. It was not alone in Parliament, Convocation,
or Privy Council that he reigned supreme; on every department of the
government service the stamp of his individual genius remains indelibly
fixed. The permanence of his work was largely due to the way in which he
clinched every reform which he introduced. He followed up the separation
from Rome by attacking in turn the bishops, clergy, and friars, and by
suppressing the monasteries. He obtained the support of the King in almost
every measure which he invented, and then forced Parliament formally to
legalize it. His action was in no case ineffective; the immediate result
of it was almost always the attainment of the goal at which he aimed.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[306]</a></p>

<p>To the student of the present day, however, who is enabled to survey
the decade of Cromwell’s rule after a lapse of more than three and a half
centuries, the immediate effects of his measures fade into the background
and lose their importance, in the face of later and far greater developments.
The latter were not always the results Cromwell wished to attain; in many
cases they were ends which, if he could have foreseen, Cromwell would
have been the last person to promote. They came years later, indirectly,
as it were, and were rendered possible only by the lapse of time, the influence
of other statesmen, and the growth and progress of civil and religious
liberty, but none the less were they due to the impulse of Thomas Cromwell.
By following out the effect of a few of the more important steps of his
policy, it will not be difficult to see what some of these later
developments were.</p>

<p>Let us take in the first place his action in rejecting the authority
of the See of Rome. Cromwell advised the King to shake off his allegiance
to the Pope, solely because he saw that a divorce from Katherine of
Aragon could never be obtained from Clement VII., as long as the latter
was in the power of Charles V. His aim was to please the King by enabling
him to divorce Katherine, so that he might marry Anne Boleyn; he realized
that his desire could not be accomplished while the country remained true
to the Old Faith; he cut the bonds that held England to Rome, and gained
what Henry wished. The direct result, the only thing he cared about, was
accomplished; but far more important than that, it was by Cromwell’s means
that Protestantism gained a footing in England, which even the Six Articles
and the terrible persecution under Mary could not shake. To guard against
the return of the Papal power, and the annulling of the divorce, Cromwell
attacked and subdued the clergy, and negotiated with the Protestants on
the Continent. His immediate object was solely political safety; the
ultimate result was the loosening of some of the strongest bonds of Romanism,
and the opening of the road for the incoming of the new religion. Thus
out of moves first made to attain and ensure a questionable end, grew
consequences so great and so far-reaching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
that it is only with difficulty that one can trace their origin.</p>

<p>The same remark will be found to hold true of the results of the
suppression of the monasteries<a id="FNanchor_745_745"/><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>.
The main object of the King’s Vicegerent in destroying them was undoubtedly
to fill the royal treasury with the spoils of the Church, and to clinch
the advantages gained by the separation from Rome. But the later result
of his measures was actually to undo much of the work which they were
first intended to perform. For though they had weakened religious
opposition to the Crown, they strengthened the secular element in its
later struggle against the royal autocracy which Cromwell had laboured to
establish. We have seen that the lands of the suppressed houses had been
either given away, or else sold at exceedingly low prices to the impoverished
nobles by Cromwell’s advice, in order to ward off the opposition aroused
by their destruction. This measure certainly attained its immediate
purpose, but it also laid the foundation for the growth of an extremely
powerful territorial aristocracy, that later on was to use its influence
to oppose the royal prerogative and pave the way for modern constitutionalism.
While Cromwell, in his attacks on the older nobility, thought that he was
removing the last impediments to absolute monarchy, he really, by
enriching and strengthening this new aristocracy, was rearing an infinitely
more potent enemy to the kingship for which he had sacrificed everything.
It is well known that such families as the Russells, Seymours, and
Cavendishes, who later figured most prominently in opposition to the
Crown, owed their power to gifts out of the revenues of the suppressed
monasteries. The smaller gentry also claimed a share in the general
advancement to wealth and prosperity among the landed proprietors, and a
sudden burst of political activity in the Lords and Commons bore witness
to the fact that the Houses had once more asserted their right to govern.</p>

<p>This brings us to Cromwell’s relations with Parliament. It is here
that we find the most striking instance of the contradiction between the
immediate and the permanent effects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of the changes he wrought. We have seen how his attitude towards Parliament
differed from that of his predecessor. We have seen how Wolsey had looked
upon the national assembly as a great force which continually hampered
his schemes, so that his dislike of it led him to summon it as infrequently
as possible, and only when it was absolutely necessary. We have seen how
Cromwell was destined to go one step further, and how by packed elections,
fraud, and violence, he succeeded in converting it into an utterly subservient
instrument of the royal will. It was now no longer a power to be feared,
but one to be relied on; a firm ally that consistently obeyed the slightest
hint of the wishes of the Crown. Consequently instead of rarely assembling
as under Wolsey, it was being constantly summoned, as a necessary means
to accomplish the designs of Henry and his minister. While the latter
lived, everything worked exactly as he had intended, and the Parliament
remained ‘tractable.’ But when after his death the idea of autocracy had
passed away, and England had begun to recover from the terror Cromwell’s
ministry had inspired, Parliament suddenly realized that it had a power
of its own. Its frequent assemblings which of course had helped the Crown,
as long as under Cromwell the Houses had remained subservient, now began
to work just the other way, and aided it in shaking off the fetters that
bound it to the King. It had been Cromwell’s plan that it should keep up
the forms of constitutional liberty, as a sort of sop to the popular feeling,
while in reality all its legislative vigour was lost. Now that the
pressure of his hand was removed, the animating spirit revived, and
finding all the old traditionary customs still intact began to infuse
itself into Lords and Commons. The earlier independence of the Houses
returned and increased, so that the final result of the work of Cromwell
was on the one hand to thwart all efforts to compass the omnipotence of
the Crown, and on the other to lay the basis for a constitutional government.</p>

<p>Had the English character been one that could permanently suffer any
form of tyranny or absolute monarchy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
had the ends the great minister aimed at been such that when the
temporary madness and terror inspired by his own personality had passed
by, they could have aroused one spark of enthusiasm in the English heart,
Cromwell’s would have been the grandest figure in his country’s history.
But it was not destined to be so. The national drift was throughout
bitterly opposed to him and to the ideas for which he stood, so that much
of his policy was reversed in the years that followed his death. There
can be, it seems to me, no doubt that Cromwell was perfectly sincere in
his attempt to establish an all-powerful kingship under the forms of
ostensible constitutionalism. He did it not from selfish motives, but
because he believed it to be the only sure road to national greatness.
The crimes that marred his career cannot be excused, but may be palliated
by this consideration, and by his dauntless courage in resolutely
destroying the Curial control of the English courts and English Church;
on this side of his work he was the true successor of Wyclif, the true
predecessor of his own great kinsman. Cromwell lived in an age when a
wave of monarchical enthusiasm swept over the entire west of Europe: a
belief in the absolute power of kings was the most salient characteristic
of the political atmosphere of his day. He was essentially a man of his
time in his faults and in his virtues, and could scarcely have anticipated
modern constitutionalism. Thus his policy perished with him, but his work
remained and was permitted by change and reaction finally to attain
results far more glorious and lasting than he had hoped for. The despotism
of the Tudors fell with their dynasty, the liberties of the nation survived.</p>

<h2>LETTERS OF THOMAS CROMWELL</h2>

<p class="pncent mbot2">PREFATORY NOTE</p>

<p>Here follow a complete collection of the letters of Thomas Cromwell
arranged as nearly as possible in chronological order, an itinerary, and
a list of his minor preferments. The letters have been copied from the
original manuscripts, save in a few cases duly noted, when transcripts
have been made from the official copies at the Public Record Office, from
Strype and Ribier, or from the collections of Sir Henry Ellis. The
spelling follows the original, all contractions are extended but italicized:
the original punctuation, paragraphing, and use of capitals are preserved.</p>

<p>But (1) I have disregarded ‘unintelligent’ or faulty marks of contraction,
occurring in words in which no letter is omitted. (2) I have not italicized
uncontracted letters inserted above the line. For example: the name
‘Thomas’ is almost always written ‘Thom<sup>a</sup>s’ in the original:
I have transcribed it ‘Thomas’ and not ‘Thom<i>a</i>s.’ On the other hand,
the word ‘your’ is usually written ‘yo<sup>r</sup>’ in the manuscript:
in this case I have taken the superior ‘r’ as a contracted form of ‘ur,’
and so have transcribed it ‘yo<i>ur</i>.’ (3) In the originals the same
script form is used for ‘I’ and ‘J’; I have followed the modern use. (4)
The bracket <span class="nowrap">[ ]</span> signifies that the words or letters enclosed would have
been in the manuscript had it not been injured. The bracket <span class="nowrap"><span class="larger">‹</span> <span class="larger">›</span></span>
signifies that the word or words enclosed have been inserted by me to
complete the sense. The parenthesis <span class="nowrap">( )</span> signifies that the enclosure is
bracketed in the original. (5) Sentences and words crossed out or
underlined in the manuscript have been set below, except when evident
mistakes of the writer. The letters ‘<i>c.o.</i>’ signify<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
that the passage against which they are written was crossed out or
underlined in the original.</p>

<p>In dating letters, I have followed the modern use, and have taken the
first of January and not the twenty-fifth of March as the beginning of
the year. I have used the bracket <span class="nowrap"><span class="larger">‹</span> <span class="larger">›</span></span>
in the headings to indicate that the name or date enclosed has not been
given in the letter itself, but has been found from external or internal
evidence. Letters which bear no indication of the day and month in which
they were written are placed at the end of the year to which they
apparently belong. The abbreviations ‘R.O.’ and ‘B.M.’ refer to the
Public Record Office and British Museum respectively throughout the
collection.</p>

<p>‘As touching the p<i>ro</i>cesse ag<i>ains</i>t yo<i>ur</i> Grace out
of the Exchequer and all other matters and suites brought
ag<i>ains</i>t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
yow I haue pleaded yo<i>ur</i> pardon, w<i>hi</i>ch is allowed in all
<i>th</i>e King’s Court<i>es</i> and by the same yo<i>ur</i> Grace
discharged of all man<i>n</i>er Causes at the K<sup>s</sup> suite.</p>

<p>Cromwell tells the Card<sup>l</sup> this solliciting his Cause hath
bin very chargeable to him and he can<i>n</i>ot susteine it any Longer
without oth<i>er</i> Respect then he hath had hertofore. I am 1000 l.
worse than I was when yo<i>ur</i> troubles began.</p>

<p>As touching yo<i>ur</i> Colleges, the King is determined to dissolve
them, and that new offices shall be found of all <i>th</i>e Lands
belonging to them newly to intitle his Highnes w<i>hi</i>ch be allready
drawn<i>e</i> for this purpose. But wheth<i>er</i> his Highnes, after
the dissolution of them meane to revive <i>th</i>em againe and founde
the<i>m</i> in his owne name, I know not. Wher<i>e</i>fore I entreat
your Grace to be content, and let yo<i>ur</i> Prince execute his pleasure.’</p>

<p class="pn mtop2">‘Cromwell to the Cardinal, May 17, 1530.</p>

<p>‘That the King hath received his Lett<i>er</i>s and is very sorry
<i>th</i>at he is in such necessity, yet that for Releefe his Ma<sup>ty</sup>
hath differed it till he speak w<i>i</i>th his Counsail. The D. of
Norfolk p<i>ro</i>miseth you his best ayd but he willeth you for the
present to be content and not much to molest the King (concerning payment
of yo<i>ur</i> Debts etc) for, as he supposeth, the time is not meet for
it. His Grace (i. e. <i>th</i>e King) shewed me how it is come to his
knowlege that yo<i>ur</i> Grace should haue cert<i>e</i>in words of him
and other Noblemen vnto my L<sup>d</sup> of Norfolk since the time of
yo<i>ur</i> adversityes w<i>hi</i>ch words should sound to make sedition
betwixt him and my Lord of Norfolk.</p>

<p>Mr. Page received yo<i>ur</i> Lett<i>er</i>s directed vnto my Lady
Anne, and delivered <i>th</i>e same. there is yet no answer. she gaue
kind words, but will not p<i>ro</i>mise to speake to the K. for you.</p>

<p>Certein Doctors of both the Vniversityes are here for the suppression
of the Lutheran opinions. The Kings H<sup>nes</sup> hath caused the sayd
doctors at divers times to assemble, and hath com<i>m</i>oned w<i>i</i>th
them. The fame is that Luther is dep<i>ar</i>ted this Life. I would he
had never bin borne.’</p>

<p class="pn mtop2">‘Cromwel writes to Card<sup>l</sup> Wolsey, August,
<span class="larger">‹</span>1530<span class="larger">›</span>.</p>

<p>‘Intreating him to haue patience etc. that there shall be some offices
sent into York and Nottinghamsh. to be found of yo<i>ur</i> Lands,
belonging to yo<i>ur</i> ArchB<i>isho</i>prick. This will be very
displeasant to you, but it is best to suffer it. for if they should not
be found you could not howld yo<i>ur</i> B<i>isho</i>prick quiet,
notw<i>i</i>thstanding yo<i>ur</i> p<i>ar</i>don: for yo<i>ur</i>
Restitution made by yo<i>ur</i> Pardon is cleerly Voyd, for that the
King did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> restitute
yo<i>ur</i> Grace before He was intitled by matter of Record. When these
offices shall be found, yo<i>ur</i> p<i>ar</i>don shall be good and
stand in parfait effect.</p>

<p>He tells him that his modest behavio<i>ur</i> and humility hath
gayned him the Love and good report of the Country where he now Lives
and allso in the Court, yet his Enemyes depraue all. S<i>ir</i>, some
there be that do allege that yo<i>ur</i> Grace doth keep too great a
Howse and family and that you are continually a-Building—for the Love of
God ther<i>e</i>fore haue a respect and refraine etc.’</p>

<p class="pn mtop2">‘Crumwell writes to <i>th</i>e Cardinal,
Octob<span class="larger">‹</span>er, 1530<span class="larger">›</span>.</p>

<p>‘I am informed yo<i>ur</i> Grace hath in me some diffidence as if I
did dissemble w<i>i</i>th you or p<i>ro</i>cure anything contrary to
yo<i>ur</i> p<i>ro</i>fit and hono<i>ur</i> I much muse that yo<i>ur</i>
Grace should so think or report it secretly considering the paines I
haue taken etc. Wherfor I beseech you to speak w<i>i</i>thout faining if
you haue such conceit, that I may cleere myself. I reckoned that yo<i>ur</i>
Grace would haue written plainly vnto me of such thing, rather than
secretly to haue misreported me etc. But I shall beare yo<i>ur</i> Grace
no Lesse good will etc. Let God judge between Vs. Trewly yo<i>ur</i>
Grace in some things overshooteth your self; there is reg[ard] to be
given what things ye vtter and to whom etc.’</p>

<p>My lorde in my right hertie wise I co<i>m</i>mende me to yo<i>ur</i>
lordship doing you to vnderstand that I haue receyued yo<i>ur</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
l<i>ette</i>res dated at Rochester the xviij<sup>th</sup> of this moneth.
In whiche ye declar<i>e</i> what craft and cu<i>n</i>nyng ye haue to
p<i>er</i>suade and to set a good countenau<i>n</i>ce vpon an yl mat<i>er</i>.
Drawing som scriptur<i>es</i> to yo<i>ur</i> purpose whiche wel weyed
acording to the plac<i>es</i> whereof they be taken. make not so muche
for yo<i>ur</i> purpose as ye allege thaim for. And wher<i>e</i> in the
first lefe of yo<i>ur</i> lett<i>er</i>s ye write that ye doubt nothing
neither before god, nor befor the worlde if nede shal that requir<i>e</i>:
so to declar<i>e</i> yo<i>ur</i>self. whatsoeuer hath been said of you.
that ye haue not deserued suche hevy word<i>es</i> or terrible thret<i>es</i>
as hath been sent from me vnto you by yo<i>ur</i> brother<a id="FNanchor_807_807"/><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a>.</p>

<p>How ye can declare yo<i>ur</i> self affor<i>e</i> god and the world
when nede shal requir<i>e</i> I can not tell, but I think verely that
yo<i>ur</i> declaration made by thes l<i>ette</i>res is far insufficie<i>n</i>t
to p<i>ro</i>ve that ye haue deserued no hevy word<i>es</i> in this
behalf and to sey playnly I sent you no hevy word<i>es</i> but word<i>es</i>
of great co<i>m</i>fort wylling yo<i>ur</i> brother to shewe you how
benigne and m<i>er</i>ciful the prince was. And that I thoug[ht] it
expedient for you to write vnto his highnes and to recognise yo<i>ur</i>
offence and desir<i>e</i> his p<i>ar</i>don, whiche his grace wold not
denye you now in yo<i>ur</i> aige and sikkenes. Whiche my counsel I wold
ye had folowed, rather than to haue writen thes l<i>ette</i>res to me
excusing yo<i>ur</i> self as thoughe there wer<i>e</i> no maner of defaute
in you. But my lord if it wer<i>e</i> in an other mannys caas than
yo<i>ur</i> owne and out of the mater whiche ye fauor I doubt not but
that ye wold think him that shuld haue doen as ye have doen non only
worthy hevy word<i>es</i> but also hevy dedys. For wher<i>e</i> ye labor
to excuse yo<i>ur</i> self of yo<i>ur</i> hering believing and co<i>n</i>celing
of the nu<i>n</i>nys fals and faynid reuelations, and of yo<i>ur</i>
manyfold sending of yo<i>ur</i> chapley[n] vnto her, by a certey<i>n</i>
intent whiche ye pretende yo<i>ur</i>self to haue had, to knowe by co<i>m</i>monyng
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her or by sendi<i>n</i>g yo<i>ur</i> chapellaine to
her, whether her reuelations wer<i>e</i> of god or no. alleging diu<i>er</i>se
scriptures. that ye wer<i>e</i> bound to p<i>ro</i>ve thaim, and not to
reiecte thaim affor<i>e</i> they wer<i>e</i> p<i>ro</i>ued My Lord whether
ye haue vsed a due meane to trie her and her reuelations, or no. It
appereth by the p<i>ro</i>cesse of yo<i>ur</i> owne l<i>ette</i>res. For
wher<i>e</i> ye write that ye had co<i>n</i>ceyuid a greate opinion of
the holines of the woman for many considerations rehersed in yo<i>ur</i>
l<i>ette</i>res c<i>om</i>p<i>ri</i>sed in vi articles, whereof the first
is grownde vpo<i>n</i> the brute and fame of her, the secunde vpon her
entreng into religion after her trauns<i>es</i> and disfiguration, the
third vpon rehersall that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
her gostly father being lerned and religious shuld testifie that she was
a maide of greate holines. The fourth vpon the report that diuerse other
vertuose prest<i>es</i> me<i>n</i> of good lernyng and reputation, shuld
so testifie of her, w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> whiche gostly father and preest<i>es</i>
ye never spake as ye confesse in yo<i>ur</i> lett<i>er</i>s. The fyveth
vpon the prayse of my late lord of Cant<i>erbury</i>, which shewed you
(as ye write) that she had many greate visions the sixt vpon this saing
of the p<i>ro</i>phete Amos, No<i>n</i> faciet d<i>om</i>in<i>u</i>s
deus v<i>er</i>bu<i>m</i>, nisi reuelau<i>er</i>it secretu<i>m</i> suu<i>m</i>
ad seruos suos p<i>ro</i>phetas by whiche co<i>n</i>siderations ye wer<i>e</i>
induced to the desir<i>e</i> to know the very certente of this mater,
whether the reuelations whiche wer<i>e</i> p<i>re</i>tended to be shewed
to her from god wer<i>e</i> true reuelations or nott? yo<i>ur</i> lordship
in al the se<i>n</i>gle<a id="FNanchor_808_808"/><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a>
of yo<i>ur</i> l<i>ette</i>res shewe not that ye made no ferther trial
vpo[n] the trueth of her and her reuelation, but only in co<i>m</i>monyng
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her and sending yo<i>ur</i> chapellaine to her,
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> Idle questions as of the thre mary magdalens. by
whiche yo<i>ur</i> co<i>m</i>mony[ng] and sending, ye tried out nothing
of her falshed, nouther (as it is credibly supposed) entended to do, as
ye myght haue doen many weyes mor<i>e</i> easely than w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
co<i>m</i>monyng w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her or sending to her; for litel
credens was to be gyven to her affirmyng her owne fayned reuelations to
be from god.</p>

<p>For if credence shuld be gyven to eu<i>er</i>y suche lewd p<i>er</i>son
as wold affirme himself to haue reuelations from god what redyer wey
wer<i>e</i> ther<i>e</i> to subuert al co<i>m</i>mon we[l]thes and good
orders in the worlde.</p>

<p>Verily my lord if ye had entended to trie out the trueth of her and
of her reuelations ye wold haue taken an other wey w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
you, first ye wold not haue been co<i>n</i>tented w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the
vayne voyc<i>es</i> of the peple making brut<i>es</i> of her traunses
&amp; disfiguratio<i>n</i> But like a wise discrete and circumspect p<i>re</i>late
ye shuld haue examined (as other haue) suche sad and credible p<i>er</i>sons
as wer<i>e</i> p<i>re</i>sent att her traunses &amp; disfiguration<i>es</i>,
not one or two, but a good nu<i>m</i>ber by whoes testimony ye shuld
haue p<i>ro</i>ued whether the brut<i>es</i> of her traunc<i>es</i> and
disfigurations wer<i>e</i> true or not And likewise ye shuld haue tried
by what craft and p<i>er</i>suasion she was made a religious woman. And
if ye had been so desirous as ye p<i>re</i>tende to enquir<i>e</i> out
the trueth or falshed of this woman and of her reuelations, it is to be
supposed ye wold haue spoken w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> her good religious and
wel lerned gostly father (as ye cal him) or this tyme: and also w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
the vertuose, and wel lerned preest<i>es</i> (as they wer<i>e</i> estemed)
of whoes reaport<i>es</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
ye were informed by thaim whiche herd thaim speke<a id="FNanchor_809_809"/><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a>
ye wold also haue been mynded to se the booke of her revelations whiche
was offerd you. of whiche ye myght haue had mor<i>e</i> trial of her and
of her reuelations, than a hundred co<i>m</i>munications w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
her, or of as many sendings of yo<i>ur</i> chapellen vnto her. As for
the late lord of Cauntreburys seying vnto you that she had many greate
visions, it ought to move you never a deale to gyve credence vnto her or
her reuelations, For the said lord knew no mor<i>e</i> certente of her
or of her reuelations than ye dyd by her owne reaport. And as towching
the saing of Amos the prophete, I thinke veryly the same moved you but a
litell to herkyn vnto her, for sythe the co<i>n</i>su<i>m</i>mation and
thende of thold testame<i>n</i>t and sythens the passion of Christ god
hathe doen many greate and notable thing<i>es</i> in the worl[d]e, whereof
he shewed no thing to his p<i>ro</i>phet<i>es</i> that hath co<i>m</i>men
to the knowlege of men. My lord all thes thinges moved you not to gyve
credence vnto her, but only the very mater whereupon she made her fals
p<i>ro</i>ficyes to whiche mater ye were so affected (as ye be noted to
be on al mat<i>er</i>s whiche ye enter ons into) that nothing could com
amysse that made for that purpose</p>

<p>And her<i>e</i> I appelle yo<i>ur</i> conscience and instantly desire
you to aunswer. Whether if she had shewed you as many reuelationsf or
the co<i>n</i>firmation of the king<i>es</i> grac<i>es</i> marriage whiche
he now enjoyeth as she did to the co<i>n</i>trary, ye wold haue gyven as
muche credence to her as ye haue doen, and wold haue let the trial of
her and of her reuelations to ou<i>er</i>passe thes many yer<i>es</i>,
wher<i>e</i> ye dwelt not from her but xx mylys, in the same shir<i>e</i>,
wher<i>e</i> her traunses and disfiguring<i>es</i> and p<i>ro</i>phecyes
in her traunses wer<i>e</i> surmised and countrefeyd. And if p<i>er</i>caas
ye wol sey (as it <span class="larger">‹</span>is<span class="larger">›</span>
not vnlike but ye wol sey mynded as ye wer<i>e</i> wont to be) that the
mat<i>e</i>rs be not like, for the Law of god in yo<i>ur</i> opinion
standeth w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the one and not w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> thother.
Suerly my lord I suppose this had been no greate cause mor<i>e</i> to
reiect the one than thother for ye know by histories of the bible that
god may by his reuelation dispense w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> his owne Law, as
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the<a id="FNanchor_810_810"/><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a>
Israelit<i>es</i> spoyling the egiptians and w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> Jacob to
haue iiij wifes, and suche other<a id="FNanchor_811_811"/><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a>.</p>

<p>Think you my lord that any indifferent man co<i>n</i>sidering the
qualite of the mater and yo<i>ur</i> affeccion, and also the negligent
passing over of suche lawful triall<i>es</i> as ye myght<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
haue had of the said nu<i>n</i>ne and her reuelations, is so dull, that
can not p<i>er</i>ceyue and discerne that yo<i>ur</i> co<i>m</i>monyng
and often sending to the said nu<i>n</i> was rather to here and know
mor<i>e</i> of her reuelations, than to trie out the trueth or falshed
of thes same And in this behalf I suppose it wol be hard for you to
purge yo<i>ur</i>self bifor<i>e</i> god or the worle, but that ye haue
been in greate defaut hering beleuyng and co<i>n</i>celing suche thing<i>es</i>
as tended to the destruction of the prince And that her reuelations
wer<i>e</i> bent and purposed to that ende . it hathe been duely
p<i>ro</i>ued, affore as greate assembly and cou<i>n</i>sel of the
lord<i>es</i> of this realme as hath been seen many yer<i>es</i>
heretofor<i>e</i> out of a p<i>a</i>rliame<i>n</i>t. And what the said
lord<i>es</i> demed thaim worthy to suffer, whiche had beleued and
co<i>n</i>celed thees fals reuelations be mor<i>e</i> terrible than any
thret<i>es</i> spoken by me to yo<i>ur</i> brother</p>

<p>And wher<i>e</i> ye go abought to defende that ye be not to be blamed
for co<i>n</i>celing her reuelations co<i>n</i>cernyng the king<i>es</i>
grace, bicause ye thought it not necessary to reherse thaim to his
highnes. for vij causes folowing in yo<i>ur</i> l<i>ette</i>res affor<i>e</i>
I shewe you my mynde co<i>n</i>cernyng thees causes, I suppose that
albeit ye p<i>er</i>caas thought it not necessary to be shewed to the
prince by you. yet that your thinking shal not be your triall, but the
Law must diffine whether ye owghted to vtter it or not.</p>

<p>And as to the first of said vii causes. Albeit<a id="FNanchor_812_812"/><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
she told youe that she had shewed her reuelations co<i>n</i>cernyng the
king<i>es</i> grace to the king herself, yet her seyng or others discharged
not you but that ye were bound by yo<i>ur</i> fidelite to shewe to the
king<i>es</i> grace . that thing whiche semed to co<i>n</i>cerne his
grace and his reigne so nyghly . for how knew you that she<a id="FNanchor_813_813"/><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>
shewed thes reuelations to the king<i>es</i> grace but by her owne
seyng, to whiche ye shuld haue gyven no suche credence as to for<i>e</i>ber<i>e</i>
the utt<i>e</i>rance of so greate maters co<i>n</i>cernyng a king<i>es</i>
welth And why shuld you so sinisterly iudge the prince that if ye had
shewed thees same vnto him, he wold haue thought that ye had brought
that tale vnto him mor<i>e</i> for the strenghing and co<i>n</i>firmatio<i>n</i>
of yo<i>ur</i> opinion then for any other thing els. Veryly my lord what
so eu<i>er</i> yo<i>ur</i> iudgeme<i>n</i>t bee . I se dayly suche benignite
and excellent humanite in his grace that I doubt not but his highnes .
wold haue accepted it in good part if ye had shewed the same reuelations
vnto him as ye wer<i>e</i> bounden to do by yo<i>ur</i> fidelite.</p>

<p>To the secunde cause. Albeit she shewed you not that any prince or
other t<i>em</i>poral lord shuld put the king<i>es</i> grace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
in daing<i>er</i> of his crowne yet there were weyes Inoughe, by whiche
her said reuelations myght haue put the king<i>es</i> grace in dainger,
as the for<i>e</i>said counsel of lord<i>es</i> . haue substancially and
duely co<i>n</i>sidered And therefor Albeit she shewed you not the meanes
whereby the dayng<i>er</i> shuld ensue to the king<i>es</i> [grace] yet .
ye wer<i>e</i> neverthelesse bounden to shewe him of the dainger.</p>

<p>To the third. Think you my lord, that if any p<i>er</i>son wold com
vnto you and shewe youe that the king<i>es</i> destruction wer<i>e</i>
co<i>n</i>spired against a certen tyme, and wold ferther shewe you, that
he wer<i>e</i> sent from his maist<i>er</i> to shewe the same to the king
and wol sey ferther vnto [you] that he wold go streyct to the king,
wer<i>e</i> it not yet your duety to certifie the king<i>es</i> grace of
the relation, but also to inquire whether the said p<i>e</i>rson had
doen his for<i>e</i>said messaige or no, yes verely. And so wer<i>e</i>
ye bound, thoughe the nu<i>n</i>ne shewed youe, it was her messaige from
god to be declared by her to the king<i>es</i> grace.</p>

<p>To the iiii<sup>th</sup> her<i>e</i> ye translate the temporal duety
that ye owe to yo<i>ur</i> prince, to the spiritual duety of suche as be
bounde to declar<i>e</i> the worde of god to the peple, and to shewe vnto
them the p<i>er</i>ill and punissheme<i>n</i>t of sy<i>n</i> in an other
worlde, the co<i>n</i>celeme<i>n</i>t whereof p<i>er</i>teyneth to the
iudgeme<i>n</i>t of god, but the co<i>n</i>celeme<i>n</i>t of this mater

<p>To the v<sup>th</sup> ther could no blame be arrested to you if ye

albeit they wer<i>e</i> aft<i>er</i>ward found fals for no man owght to
be blamed doing his duety And if a man wold shewe you secretly that there
wer<i>e</i> a greate mischief entended . against the prince, wer<i>e</i>
ye to be blamed if ye shewed him of it, albeit it wer<i>e</i> a fayned
tale, and the said mischief wer<i>e</i> never Imagined.</p>

<p>To the sixt . co<i>n</i>cernyng an Imagination of mast<i>er</i> Pacy.
It was knowen that he was beside himself, and therefor<i>e</i> they
wer<i>e</i> not blamed that made no report thereof, but it was not lik
in this caas For ye toke not this nu<i>n</i>ne for a mad woman, for if
ye had ye wold not haue gyven vnto her so greate credence as ye dyd.</p>

<p>To the final and vii<sup>th</sup> cause wher<i>e</i> ye lay<a id="FNanchor_814_814"/><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
vnto the charge of o<i>ur</i> sou<i>er</i>aine, that he hath vnkyndly

letters for shewing his grace trowthe in his greate mater, whereby ye
wer<i>e</i> disco<i>m</i>forted to shewe vnto him the nu<i>n</i>nys reuelations.
I beleue that I know the king<i>es</i> goodnes and natural gentilnes so
well, that his grace wold not so vnkyndly handle you, as you vnkyndly
write of him, onles ye gave him other causes than be expressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
in yo<i>ur</i> lett<i>er</i>s. And what so eu<i>er</i> the king<i>es</i>
grace hath sayed or writen vnto you heretofore, yet that notw<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>stonden,
ye wer<i>e</i> neverthelesse bounden to vtt<i>er</i> to him thees
p<i>er</i>nicious reuelations.</p>

<p>Finally Wher<i>e</i> ye desir<i>e</i> for the passion of christ that
ye be no mor<i>e</i> quykkened in this mater for if ye be put to that
straite ye wyl not lose yo<i>ur</i> soule, but ye wyl speke as yo<i>ur</i>
co<i>n</i>science ledeth you w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> many moo word<i>es</i>

yo<i>ur</i> brother and folowed the same, submitting yo<i>ur</i>self by
yo<i>ur</i> letters to the king<i>es</i> grace for yo<i>ur</i> offenses

so far p<i>ro</i>mise you<a id="FNanchor_815_815"/><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>.
And suerly my lord if the mat<i>er</i> co<i>m</i> to triall: yo<i>ur</i>

whiche be against you wolbe sufficient to co<i>n</i>demne you Wher<i>e</i>for
my lord I wol eftsones aduise you that laying apart al suche excuses as
ye haue alleged in yo<i>ur</i> letters whiche in my<i>n</i> opinion be
of smal effect as I haue declared ye beseche the king<i>es</i> grace by
yo<i>ur</i> lett<i>er</i>s to be yo<i>ur</i> graciou[s] lord, and to

by yo<i>ur</i> saide l<i>ette</i>res aswell of the publique occurrant<i>es</i>
there as of the King<i>es</i> highnes pryuate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
affairees I haue aliwayes intymated and declared the same to the king<i>es</i>
maiestie who right thankefully and acceptablie taketh and estemeth
yo<i>ur</i> diligence in wryting And now having p<i>er</i>vsed and redde
both yo<i>ur</i> l<i>ette</i>res addressed to his maieste and also to me
his highnes hathe speciallie noted in the same amongst other that the
bisshop of Rome speking w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> you shewed himself veray propice
and desirous to gratefie his saide highnes And that he had sent for out
of Ethrurie twoo Lawyers being singulerly well lerned in whose doctrine
and good iudgement he hathe grete trust and confidence Whose sentenc<i>es</i>
and opynyons do stonde hollie w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the king<i>es</i> highnes
cause Affirmyng (as ye wryte) that the saide Bisshop of Rome of his duetie
and office ought to approbate and confyrme this p<i>re</i>sent matrymonie
albeit it depended vppon the validite of the dispensacion made by Julius.
So as Notw<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>stonding that the king<i>es</i> maiestie having
his saide cause sufficientlie diffyned and being himself in that behalf
resolutely determyned and grounded as vppon the foundacion of veryte and
trowth hathe discharged his conscience therein (like a good vertuous and
catholique prynce) afore god and the worlde Yet his maieste dothe in suche
sence interpretate yo<i>ur</i> l<i>ette</i>res that (as appereth by the
same) the saide bisshop of Rome begynneth now somwhat to sauo<i>ur</i>
and fele the iustnes and equyte of the saide cause and p<i>ar</i>telie
to stande w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the King<i>es</i> maiestie in the same. Wherefore
if the saide bisshop of Rome do in dede bere so frendelie and syncere
good mynde and will toward<i>es</i> the king<i>es</i> highnes (as ye do
wryte) or rather if he love the trewth as it beco<i>m</i>meth eu<i>er</i>y
good man to do setting ap<i>ar</i>te all hatred and affection it is his
parte to shew the same now to the vnyu<i>er</i>sall worlde in this most
iust and rightcious cause by his owne publique testymonye and approbacion.
And of his owne free will and w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>out any sute or intercession
of the king<i>es</i> maiestie onelie adhering to the trewth and negle<i>c</i>ting
all other respect<i>es</i> to p<i>ro</i>nounce the invalidite of the
first mat<i>ri</i>mony and the validite of the seconde according to the
sentenc<i>es</i> iudgement<i>es</i> and diffynytions of the saide ii<sup>o</sup>
lerned men which as ye wryte the saide bisshop of Rome called and sent
for vnto him for that purpose which if the saide Bisshop of Rome will,
surely he shall do <span class="larger">‹</span>a<span class="larger">›</span>
thing wo<i>ur</i>thie his office and merite of god and the worlde and to
the king<i>es</i> highnes veray thankefull and acceptable pleasure, and
also to him self and his see moche more p<i>ro</i>fite and good then now
nedeth to expresse. And you for yo<i>ur</i> p<i>ar</i>te if in this matier
as of yo<i>ur</i> self ye can any thing p<i>ro</i>fite or p<i>re</i>vaile
by yo<i>ur</i> good policie and dexteryte toward<i>es</i> the conducyng<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
of the saide Bisshop of Rome to that conformyte (as ye wryte in yo<i>ur</i>
saide l<i>ette</i>res) ye shall then vndoubtedlie answer to the king<i>es</i>
highnes expectac<i>i</i>on And the same p<i>ro</i>ceding of the beneuolence
of the saide Bisshop of Rome and the zele that he hathe to the due
execucion of his office and duetie shalbe the more grate and acceptable
a grete dell to the King<i>es</i> highnes and the hole wo<i>ur</i>lde,
seeing that the mere veryte and the respecte that he hath to god and his

hathe youen me in co<i>m</i>maundement to make you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
answer as here insueth. First touching suche leases as it is supposed shoulde
be made by the Duke of Suffolke, the king<i>es</i> highnes seyeth that he
knoweth not that the saide Duke or his officers haue made any lease syns
the co<i>m</i>munycac<i>i</i>on had betwixt them of this bargayn, but his
highnes is certenly info<i>ur</i>med that the saide Duke or his officers
haue offered to make fourth certen leases syns the tyme of the saide co<i>m</i>munycac<i>i</i>on
had. Whereof his maieste can not but mervaile and for the same conceyueth
som ingratitude and vnkyndenes in the said Duke if it can so be proved.
Secondely touching the Decay of Ewelme and Donyngton the king<i>es</i>
highnes answered that what soeuer the saide Duke hathe spent vppon them,
it may well appere in what decay they stonde, and who soeu<i>er</i> shall
view them shall facilly p<i>er</i>ceyue that grete somes of money will
not sufficientlie repaire them as his highnes himself w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> his
eye hath vewed the saide Ewelme at his grac<i>es</i> late being there.
And for Donyngton the house is not onelie in decay but also the keper of
the same Mr. Fetyplace hath both consumed and distroyed the Dere and game
there and also wasted the wood<i>es</i> in such wise as it is thought he
hathe not onelie forfaited his patent but also right ill deserued to haue
eyther fee or thanke for any good service he hathe don there. And semblablie
the king<i>es</i> highnes hauing ben at Hokenorton whiche his grace lyketh
veray well can not perceyue ne also his Surueyo<i>ur</i>s sent thither can
not see how that xv<sup>e</sup> li should be employed there as it is affirmed
by the saide Duke, so as it is not vnlike but that the saide Duke hathe
ben deceyued by his officers. And whatsoeu<i>er</i> hath ben spent there,
yet will it requyre no small so<i>m</i>mes of money to repare and buylde
it after the king<i>es</i> mynde and pleasure whiche wilbe chargeable to
his highnes. And touching the game of the red Dere at Hokenorton aforsaide,
his maiestie Doubtith not but that the saide Duke will iustefie his couuen<i>au</i>nte
and agrement w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the keper for the keping of lxxx red
dere there accordinglie. Thirdely concerning the reuersions of the lady
Gordon and John Verney the king<i>es</i> highnes p<i>er</i>ceyuing the
conformyte of the saide Duke in that behalf and also yo<i>ur</i> travaile
and diligence in the same gyueth vnto him and you both therefore his
grac<i>es</i> hertie and condigne thank<i>es</i>. Trusting that like as
his highnes hathe heretofore mynystered grete benefit<i>es</i> and co<i>m</i>modytees
vnto the saide Duke, who hathe atteyned this degree hono<i>ur</i> and
astate that he now is in by the meanes and onely ad<i>ua</i>uncement of
the king<i>es</i> saide highnes. So the saide Duke wilbe contented to
departe w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the saide reu<i>er</i>sions frankely and frely
to his highnes of his mere lyberalite to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
extende toward<i>es</i> him, and to permytte his maiestee to haue the
saide reu<i>er</i>sions w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in his bargayn alredy made as
his grace thought he had had, onely trusting to his grac<i>es</i> bountie
and goodnes for the recompence of the same. Wherein the king<i>es</i>
pleasure is ye shalbe playne w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the saide Duke, vttering
and declaring vnto him the good opynyon which the king<i>es</i> highnes
hathe conceyved in his conformyte toward<i>es</i> all his gra<i>ci</i>ous
request<i>es</i> and affairees, and how he of all men is thereunto bounde
if he do well consider the manyfold benefit<i>es</i> that he hath receyued
at the king<i>es</i> hande. Wherefore ye may counsaile him not to gyue
any cause or occasion in this behalf to the kyng<i>es</i> highnes to
conceyve any Jalousie or mistrust in him but that rather he will shew
herein his frankenes and liberall herte toward<i>es</i> his maiestie
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>out stycking w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> his grace in so small
a matier. And so doing let him be assured that like as the king<i>es</i>
highnes heretofore for lesse cause youen on the saide Duk<i>es</i> p<i>ar</i>te,
hathe ad<i>ua</i>unced him to this hono<i>ur</i> and astate that he now

frankenes and gentill liberalite of the saide Duke in this behalf if he
frankely do com forward<i>es</i> w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the same. And Fynally
I pray you on my behalf to say somwhat to the saide Duke in this matier
alledging vnto him that as I am, alwayes haue be<i>e</i>n, and eu<i>er</i>
wilbe his grac<i>es</i> poure frende so I requere him not to stycke w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
the king<i>es</i> highnes in this matier, and pray his grace not to doubte
but that the king<i>es</i> highnes wilbe as good lorde to him in recompence
of the saide reu<i>er</i>sions as if his highnes Did now parte and couue<i>na</i>unte
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> him for the same aforehand. Wherein eftesones I pray
you shew him on my behalf that my poure and frendelie aduise is that his
g<i>ra</i>ce shall liberally wryte to the king<i>es</i> highnes in this
matier so as his highnes may thereby p<i>er</i>ceyue the saide Duk<i>es</i>

as in all other thing<i>es</i>. Which be ye assured in myn opynyon shalbe
more beneficyall vnto the saide Duke then x tymes so moche lande as the
saide reuersions Do amount vnto. Requering you so to shew his grace fro
me as from him that wold be as glad of his grac<i>es</i> welth and p<i>ro</i>speryte
as any one of his poure frend<i>es</i>. So knoweth o<i>ur</i> lorde who

<p>Sir after my most hertie reco<i>m</i>mendacions these shalbe to adu<i>er</i>tise you

Ye shall vnderstonde that his highnes co<i>m</i>maundid me to make you

his highnes dowtith not but seeing bothe the Frensh king and also the grete

shall requyre not cease to call vppon them till it be Depeched And ferther
considering that the saide frensh king vppon yo<i>ur</i> saide Demaunde
of the saide pensions so sodaynelye fell into co<i>m</i>munycacion w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
you aswell of his frendeship and humanyte shewed to the kyng<i>es</i> highnes,

w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the Frensh kyng or at the least w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the

that he hath at all tymes answered for the kyng<i>es</i> highnes in his

his p<i>ro</i>cedyng<i>es</i> to be iust and vpright concernyng the Matrymony

the said frensh kyng hathe as he sayeth answered at all tymes on the king<i>es</i>
p<i>ar</i>te, he hathe don<i>e</i> nothing but the p<i>ar</i>te of a brother
in iustefieng and verefyeng the trewth, and so contynuyng shall Do as ap<i>er</i>teyneth
to a prynce of hono<i>ur</i> which the king<i>es</i> highnes doubtith not

the amyte betwixt them both iustlye requyring the same. And concerning
thexecuc<i>i</i>ons Don<i>e</i> w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this realme ye shall
sey to the saide Frensh Kyng that the same were not so mervelous extreme as
he alledgeth, for touching Mr. More and the Bisshop of Rochester w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
suche others as were executed here, their treasons conspiracies and practises
secretely practised aswell w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in the realme w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>out
to move and styrre discension and to sowe sedycyon w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in
the realme, intending thereby not onelye the distruction of the kyng but
also the hole subuersion of his highnes realme being explaned and declared and
so manyfestly proved afore them that they could not avoyde nor Denye it
and they thereof openly detected and lawfully convicted adiudged and condempned
of high treason by the Due order of the lawes of this realme, it shall and
may well appere to all the worlde that they having such malice roted in
their hert<i>es</i> ayenst their prynce and Sou<i>er</i>eigne and the totall
Distruction of the co<i>m</i>men weale of this realme, were well wo<i>r</i>thie if
they had had a thousande lyves to haue suffered x tymes a more terrible
Deth and execucion then any of them Did suffer. And touching suche word<i>es</i>
as the saide frensh kyng spake vnto you concernyng how Mr. More dyed and
what he saied to his doughter going to his iudgement and also what exhortacions
he shoulde gyue vnto the kyng<i>es</i> subiect<i>es</i> to be trew and obedient
to his grace (assuring you that there was no such thing) whereof the gret
M<i>aster</i> promysed you a Double at length. In that the king<i>es</i>
pleasure is that ye shall not onelie procure the saide double and sende
it hither but also sey vnto the saide frensh king that the kyng<i>es</i>
highnes can not otherwise take it but veraye vnkyndely that the saide frensh
king or any of his counsaile at whose hand<i>es</i> he hathe so moche meryted
and to whom he hathe mynystered so many grete benefit<i>es</i> pleasures
and co<i>m</i>modytees shoulde so lightly gyue eare faith and credence
to any such vayne brut<i>es</i> and fleeng tales Not hauyng first knowlege
or adu<i>er</i>tisement from the king<i>es</i> highnes here and his counsaile
of the veryte and trewth, Affirming it to be the office of a frende hering
any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">[418]</a></span> suche tales
of so noble a prynce rather to haue compressed the bruters thereof to sylence
or at the leest not p<i>er</i>mytted them to haue dyvulged the same vntill
such tyme as the king<i>es</i> maiestee being so dere a frende had ben adu<i>er</i>tesed
thereof and the trewth knowen before he shoulde so lightly beleve or allege
any suche reporte which ingrate and vnkynde Demeanure of the saide frensh
king vsed in this behalf argueth playneleye not to remayn in his brest such
integryte of herte and syncere amyte toward<i>es</i> the king<i>es</i>
highnes and his p<i>ro</i>ceding<i>es</i> as his highnes alwayes heretofore hathe
expected and loked for. Which thing Ye may propone and alledge vnto the
saide frensh king and the grete Maister or to one of them w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
suche modestie and sobrenes as ye thinke they maye p<i>er</i>ceyue that
the king<i>es</i> highnes hathe good and iust cause in this p<i>ar</i>te somwhat
to take their light credence vnkyndelye. And where as the saide frensh
king sayeth that touching such lawes as the king<i>es</i> highnes hathe
made he will not medle w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>all alledging it not to be mete
that one prynce should desire a nother to chaunge his lawes sayeng that
his be to olde to be ch<i>a</i>unged, to that ye shall sey that such
lawes as the king<i>es</i> highnes hathe made here be not made w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>out
substauncyall ground<i>es</i> by grete and mature aduise counsaile and
deliberacion of the hole polycie of this realme and are indede no new
lawes but of grete antiquyte and many yeres passed were made and executed
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this realme as now they be renovate and renewed
onlye in respecte to the comen weale of the same. And it is not a litle
to his highnes m<i>er</i>vaile that the saide frensh kyng eu<i>er</i>
wolde counsaile or aduyse him if in case hereafter any suche like offenders
should happen to be in this realme that he should rather banyssh them
then in suche wise execute them And specyallie considering that the saide
frensh king himself in co<i>m</i>monyng w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> you at that
tyme not onely confessed thextreme execucyons and grete Bruyllie of late
don in his realme But also that he now intendeth to w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>draw
the same and to revoke and to call home agayn such as be out of his
realme the king<i>es</i> highnes therefore the more straungely taketh
his saide aduise and counsaile Supposing it to be neyther thoffice of a
frende nor of a brother that he wold Determyn himself to call home into
his realme agayn his subiect<i>es</i> being out of the same for speking
ayenst the Bisshop of Romes vsurped auctoryte, and counsaile the kynges
highnes to banysshe his traytours into straunge p<i>ar</i>tes where they
myght haue good occasion tyme place and oportunyte to w<i>or</i>ke their
feat<i>es</i> of treason and conspiracie the better agaynst the king<i>es</i>
highnes and this his realme. In which p<i>ar</i>te ye shall somwhat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
engreve the matier after such sorte as it may well appere to the saide
frensh king that not onelie the king<i>es</i> highnes might take those
his counsailes and co<i>m</i>munycac<i>i</i>ons both straungely and vnkyndely
thinking the same not to procede of mere amyte and frendship, but also
vsing such polycie and austeryte in proponyng the same w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>
the saide frensh king and the grete Maister taking such tyme and oportunyte
as may best serue for the same, as they may well p<i>er</i>ceyue the
king<i>es</i> highnes preceding<i>es</i> here w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this
realme both concerning the saide execucyons and all other thing<i>es</i>
to be onely groundid vppon iustice and the equyte of his lawes which be
no new lawes but auncyent lawes made and establisshed of many yeres passed
w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i>in this realme and now renovate and renewed as is aforesaide
for the better order weale and suretie of the same. And ye may ferther
say that if the frensh king and his counsaile well consyder as they ought
to do that it were moch better to adu<i>au</i>nce the punysshment of traito<i>u</i>rs
and rebell<i>es</i> for their offenc<i>es</i> then to ponysshe such as
do speke ayenst the vsurped auctoryte of the bisshop of Rome who Daylie
goth about to suppresse and subdue kyng<i>es</i> and prync<i>es</i> and
their auctorytee gyuen to them by goddes worde. All which matiers the
kyng<i>es</i> pleasure is that ye shall take tyme and occasion as ye
talkyng agayn w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> the frensh king or the grete Maister
may declare yo<i>ur</i> mynde as before is p<i>re</i>scribed vnto you.
Adding thereunto such matier w<i>i</i>t<i>h</i> such reasons after yo<i>ur</i>
accustomed dexteryte &amp; discression as ye shall thinke most expedyent
and to serve best for the king<i>es</i> purpose, Defence of his proceding<i>es</i>
and the profe of the frensh king<i>es</i> ingratitude shewed in this
behalf. Not Doubting in yo<i>ur</i> wisedom good industrie and discrete
circumspection for thordering and well handeling of the same accordinglye.</p>

<p>And touching Melanchton<a id="FNanchor_843_843"/><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a>
considering there is no lykelihod of his repayree into Fraunce as I haue
well p<i>er</i>ceyued by yo<i>ur</i> l<i>ette</i>res, the kyng<i>es</i>
highnes therfore hath appoyntid Cristofer Mount indelaiedlie to take his
io<i>ur</i>ney where Melanchton is and if he com<i>e</i> to prevente
Mouns<i>ieur</i> de Langie in suche wise as the saide Melancton his
repayre into Fraunce may be stayed and dyu<i>er</i>tid into Englond Not
doubting but the same shall take effect accordynglie. And as to Mr. Heynes
the kyng<i>es</i> pleasure is that he shall go to Parys there to<a id="FNanchor_844_844"/><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a>
lerne and dissiphre the opynyons of the lernid men and their inclynacions
and affections aswell toward<i>es</i> the kyng<i>es</i> highnes p<i>ro</i>ceding<i>es</i>
as to the bisshop of Rome his vsurped power and auctoryte, after such

salutiferos, vberrime nunciabant; recentiores vero iste eo nomine gratiores
acceptioresque extitere quod succinte atque distincte totius expeditionis

per ministrum suum vestra dominatio mecum agit et de quo statuendo iniectis
comperendinationibus se protrahi suspicatur, non possum pro mutue nostre
coniunctionis sinceriorisque amicitie vinculo, eam non summopere rogare,
et pro innata sua prudentia et animi equitate, boni consulere velit, quicquid
in hoc Dominationis vestre desiderio deffertur quum nihil interim omittatur
quod ex Serenissimi domini mei regis honore et dignitate, simulque illustrissime

esse posset. Itaque quam possum ex animo dominationem vestram obsecro,
vt suum istud illustrissimam dominam mariam inuisendi desiderium ab amico

<p><a id="Footnote_21_21"/><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> It is possible that the Thomas Smyth, whose name occurs so frequently in the Court Rolls, was identical with a certain ‘tryumphant trollynge Thomas Smyth,’ who, in 1541, wrote several ballads ‘declaring the despyte of a secrete sedycyous person,’ by name William Graye, who had composed certain verses very derogatory to the memory of Thomas Cromwell. This Thomas Smyth describes himself as ‘servaunt to the Kynges royall Majestye, and clerke of the Quenes Graces Counsell, though most unworthy’; he had perhaps obtained his position through the influence of the King’s minister. He was supported in his tirade against Graye by ‘the ryght redolent and rotunde rethorician R. Smyth <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> in an Artificiall apologie articulerlye answerynge to the obstreperous obgannynges of one W. G. evometyd to the vituperacyon of the tryumphant trollynge Thomas Smyth <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> to thende that the imprudent lector shulde not tytubate or hallucinate in the labyrinthes of this lucubratiuncle.’ ‘R. Smyth’ was probably another member of the Smyth-Cromwell tribe. The name ‘Ric<i>ard</i>us Smyth’ occurs frequently in the Court Rolls (Cal. xvi. 423).</p>

The suggestion of Mr. Galton (The Character and Times of Thomas Cromwell, p. 22) that ‘Garigliano’ may be a mistake for ‘Marignano’ is scarcely plausible. The great victory of Francis I occurred in 1515, when there is every reason to suppose that Cromwell was in England.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_25_25"/><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The fact that this tale concerns itself with Foxe’s native town of Boston increases the probability of its authenticity.

<p><a id="Footnote_50_50"/><a href="#FNanchor_50_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> On the 29th of April Wolsey entered the House and proposed a subsidy ‘which he thought should not fall short of £800,000, to be raised by a tax of four shillings in the pound on all men’s goods and lands.’ The principal provisions of the Act to which the Commons were finally induced to give their consent were as follows: for two years ‘a rate of 5 per cent. was imposed on all lands and goods of the value of £20 and upwards; 2½ per cent. on goods between £20 and £2; 1⅔ per cent. on goods of 40s., or on yearly wages averaging 20s. In the third year 5 per cent. on all lands of £50 and upwards; and in the fourth and last year, 5 per cent. on personal property of £50 and upwards. These rates were doubled in cases of aliens. The Act was not to extend to Ireland, Wales, Calais, to the counties of Northumberland, Cumberland, or Westmoreland, to Chester, to the bishopric of Durham, or to Brighton in Sussex.’ (Cf. Introduction to vol. iii of the Calendar, pp. 243, 253, 270.) Brewer informs us that ‘it had been computed that the subsidy granted by the Commons would produce £800,000,’ though he confesses that we are ignorant of the data on which this estimate was based. Lingard does not discuss the amount of the subsidy, but lays stress on the fact that the Commons asserted their right to debate on the measure alone. (Hist. of England, vol. vi. pp. 91–92.)</p>

Neither Brewer nor Gairdner question it, and Pauli, in an article on Wolsey and the Parliament of 1523 (Historische Zeitschrift for 1889, p. 52), says, ‘Die Rede selbst kann schlechterdings keinen anderen Urheber haben, und ist späterhin bei der Confiscation der Papiere Cromwell’s in das Staatsarchiv gekommen.’</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_186_186"/><a href="#FNanchor_186_186"><span class="label">[186]</span></a> This account was drawn up by Pole in 1538. Canon Dixon (History of the Church of England, vol. i. p. 41) questions the truth of the story on the ground that The Prince was not published until 1532, several years after the reported conversation took place. The book, however, was written in 1513, as Canon Dixon admits, and there is every probability, especially in view of his early experiences in Italy, that Cromwell possessed a manuscript copy. Pole, moreover, expressly states that Cromwell offered to lend him the work, provided he would promise to read it.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_188_188"/><a href="#FNanchor_188_188"><span class="label">[188]</span></a> The chronicler, John Stow, in his Survey of London, p. 180, gives the following anecdote, which proves that Cromwell was no less arbitrary as a man than as a minister:—</p>
<p>‘On the south side and at the west end of this church (the Austin Friars) many fayre houses are builded, namely in Throgmorton streete, one very large and spacious, builded in the place of olde and small Tenementes by Thomas <span class="nowrap">Cromwell. . . .</span>  This house being finished, and hauing some reasonable plot of ground left for a Garden, he caused the pales of the Gardens adioyning to the north parte thereof on a sodaine to be taken downe, 22 foot to bee measured forth right into the north of euery man’s ground, a line there to bee drawen, a trench to bee cast, a foundation laid, and a highe bricke wall to bee builded. My father had a Garden there, and an house standing close to his south pale, this house they lowsed from the ground &amp; bare vpon Rowlers into my Father’s Garden 22 foot, ere my Father heard thereof: no warning was given him, nor any other answere when hee spake to the surueyers of that worke but that their Mayster Sir Thomas commaunded them so to doe, no man durst go to argue the matter, but each man lost his land, and my Father payde his whole rent, which was vi<sup>s</sup>. viii<sup>d</sup>. the yeare, for that halfe which was left. Thus much of mine owne knowledge haue I thought good to note, that the suddaine rising of some men, causeth them to forget themselves.’</p>

There is every reason to believe in the veracity of this report. Pole was in London at the time, and knew Cromwell intimately. He reiterates the truth of his tale in the following words:—‘Hoc possum affirmare nihil in illa oratione positum alicujus momenti quod non vel ab eodem nuncio (Cromwell himself) eo narrante intellexi, vel ab illis qui ejus consilii fuerunt participes.’ This interview was doubtless the one which Chapuys describes as due to the quarrel with Sir John Wallop. According to both accounts it ended by Cromwell’s becoming a Privy Councillor.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_257_257"/><a href="#FNanchor_257_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> The following passage from a letter which Gardiner wrote to the Protector Somerset in the reign of Edward VI. gives a slightly different account of the origin of the Act about Proclamations:—</p>
<p>‘Whether the King may command against the Common Law or an Act of Parliament there is never a Judge, or other man in the realm, ought to know more by experience of that the Lawyers have said, than I <span class="nowrap">. . .</span> being of the Council, when many Proclamations were devised against the Carriers out of Corn; when it came to punishing the Offenders the Judges would answer, it might not be by the Laws, because the Act of Parliament gave liberty, Wheat being under a price: wherupon at the last followed the Act of Proclamations, in the passing whereof were many large words.’</p>
<p>It will be noticed that this account of the origin of the Act is in many ways similar to that contained in Cromwell’s letter: the chief difference being that according to the latter the measure was adopted to prevent the export of <i>coin</i>, while Gardiner informs us that the statute was devised to prevent the export of <i>corn</i>. It is possible that the Bishop of Winchester, writing so many years later, had forgotten the exact circumstances, and was really referring to the same incident as that described by Cromwell. Burnet has printed Gardiner’s letter in full (Collection of Records and Original Papers, &amp;c., part ii, book i, no. 14), but he does not seem to have made use of the information it contains; for in another part of his work (part i, book iii, p. 423) he asserts that the Act about Proclamations was the result of the great exceptions made to the legality of the King’s proceedings in the articles about religion and other injunctions published by his authority, which were complained of as contrary to law. Hallam (vol. i. p. 35 <i>n.</i>) apparently agrees with Burnet in this last statement, and ignores the evidence supplied by the letter of the Bishop of Winchester. It is probable that both writers have gone astray in this matter. The opposition aroused by the King’s ecclesiastical proclamations may have hastened the passage of the Act, but they can scarcely be regarded as its origin in the face of the testimony of Cromwell and Gardiner. Burnet and Hallam were perhaps led to ascribe the source of the statute to religious matters, by the fact that the Act was passed almost simultaneously with the Six Articles, and by the special provision which it contained concerning heretics.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_258_258"/><a href="#FNanchor_258_258"><span class="label">[258]</span></a> Canon Dixon (History of the Church of England, vol. ii. p. 129) sees in the Act about Proclamations ‘a timid attempt to draw the prerogative within the limits of regular legislation,’ and seeks to show that its true intent was to curtail, while legalizing, a power which the Crown had exercised hitherto illegally and without any restraint. It is doubtless true that the King had issued proclamations before, and had enforced obedience to them, without the sanction of law; and it is equally certain that the intent of this Act (like that of so many others which Cromwell devised) was to legalize a privilege of which the Crown had already made use. But it is more difficult to agree with the reasoning by which Canon Dixon attempts to show that the true purpose of this process of legalization was to restrict and not to confirm the power of the King. It is pretty certain that the practical value of these limitations was in reality far less than at first appeared; for, as Hallam and Burnet justly remark, the immediate effect of them was to confer great power on the judges, upon whom the duty of interpreting the statute devolved; and the judges—mere puppets in the hands of Henry and Cromwell—were sure to render every verdict in favour of the Crown. The exceptions in the Act about Proclamations may well be compared to the <i>Quantum per Christi legem licet</i>, which had been tacked on to the recognition of the King’s Supremacy. Both were concessions granted merely as a sop to the popular feeling: both were so guarded that they could easily be rendered nugatory. Finally, the fact that Cromwell himself was so active in assisting the passage of this statute should be a conclusive proof that its real aim was not to legalize and limit, but to legalize and confirm the power of the Crown. The straightforward verdicts of Hume and Hallam on the true significance of the Act are certainly correct: ‘The prerogative could not soar to the heights it aimed at, till thus imped by the perfidious hand of Parliament.’ The fact that the statute was repealed in the first year of Edward VI. simply proves that it was so unpopular that it was impossible to renew it, when the strong hand of Henry VIII. had been removed. Cf. Hume, vol. iii. pp. 255, 256; Hallam, vol. i. p. 35; and Blackstone, vol. i. p. 269. There is a curious passage in Beowulf (ll. 67–73), in which the King rules as he wills, saving his subjects’ lives and heritages, that is in striking congruence with this Act.</p>

It was overlooked at the time of the compilation of the tenth volume of the Calendar, and escaped the search of Froude and Friedmann, both of whom discuss the details of this election at some length. Its discovery throws much fresh light on the history of one of the most famous cases of arbitrary interference in the choice of members to Parliament that has come down to us from Tudor times. The reply of the Mayor (Cal. x. 929) is comparatively well known. Froude has printed it in full (vol. iii. p. 347), but has misread the name of one of the burgesses, which is ‘Darkenall’ or ‘Derknall,’ not ‘Sacknell.’</p>

It seems very improbable then that Cromwell wrote them, and I have not placed them among the letters.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_315_315"/><a href="#FNanchor_315_315"><span class="label">[315]</span></a> An event which took place in July, 1536, may possibly have been the source of this rumour. It appears that Cromwell had a gold ring made, with the figures of the Queen, King, and Princess carved on it, and the following Latin inscription:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">‘Obedientia unitatem parit,</div>
      <div class="verse">Unitas animi quietem et constantiam;</div>
      <div class="verse">Constans vero animi quies thesaurus inestimabilis.</div>
      <div class="verse">Respexit humilitatem</div>
      <div class="verse">Qui in Filio nobis reliquit</div>
      <div class="verse">Perfectum humilitatis exemplar.</div>
      <div class="verse">Factus est obediens Patri.</div>
      <div class="verse">Et ipsa etiam natura parentibus</div>
      <div class="verse">Et patrie obediendum docuit.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This ring he intended to bestow on the Princess Mary, but apparently the King got wind of the plan and put a stop to it, taking the ring away from his minister, on the plea that he desired to have the honour of presenting it to his daughter himself. The episode should have been sufficient to show that even if Cromwell had any idea of marrying the Princess, the King’s opposition to the plan would prove insurmountable. The inscription on the ring, moreover, surely indicates that the gift was intended rather as a reminder to the Princess of her duty towards her father, than as a preliminary to a matrimonial proposal. Cal. xi. 148.</p>

The King and Cromwell were both absent on a tour in the west and south of England from the end of July until the beginning of October, 1535. Chapuys states that the object of this trip was to win the affection of the people on the Borders of Wales, and to enjoy the excellent hunting which that region afforded. It is probable that Henry and Cromwell were also desirous personally to inform themselves concerning the religious houses in the south and west counties, before permitting their agents to complete the visitation. Cal. ix. 58.</p>

Cromwell also took good care that some of the suppressed houses also should fall to his portion. He ‘appropriated to his own share the rich Priory of Lewes in Sussex (including its cell of Melton-Mowbray in Leicestershire), the Priory of Michelham in the same county, that of Modenham in Kent, of St. Osythe in Essex, Alceter in Warwickshire, Yarmouth in Norfolk, and Laund in Leicestershire. Sir Richard Cromwell, his nephew, and great-grandfather of Oliver, received Ramsey Abbey, Hinchinbrooke Nunnery, Sawtry Abbey, St. Neot’s Priory, and a house of Austin canons in Huntingdonshire, with Neath Abbey in Glamorganshire, and St. Helen’s Nunnery in London.’ Blunt, vol. i. p. 377.

It is said that Cromwell, in the course of these prosecutions, contrived to deprive the victims of all chance of escape by inquiring of the judges whether, if a man were condemned to death for treason in Parliament without a hearing, the attainder could ever be disputed. He finally succeeded in obtaining the reluctant but correct reply that ‘an attainder in Parliament, whether or not the party had been heard in his own defence, could never be reversed in a court of law.’ Cf. Hallam, vol. i. pp. 29–30. Coke, Fourth Institute, p. 38, adds, ‘The party against whom this was intended was never called in question, but the first man after the said resolution, that was so attainted, and never called to answer, was the said Earl of Essex (Thomas Cromwell): whereupon that erroneous and vulgar opinion amongst our historians grew, that he died by the same law which he himself had made.’</p>

M. Bapst (Deux Gentilshommes, pp. 97, 113), on the other hand, thinks that the King’s minister originally favoured the French alliance, and adhered to it until 1535. Neither writer produces any very conclusive evidence in support of his theory: but Mr. Friedmann’s view is certainly, on the face of it, the more plausible. It may be too much to say that it was by Cromwell’s advice that Francis was insulted at Marseilles, but it is certain that the King’s minister evinced a decided preference for an Imperial alliance long before the year 1535.

Mr. Friedmann points out that this quarrel of Henry and Cromwell about the Spanish alliance was intimately connected with the fate of Anne Boleyn. The Emperor, too cautious to express any indignation at the news of his aunt’s death, was still planning for the safety and, if possible, the succession of his cousin the Princess Mary. On hearing from Chapuys of the possibility of a renewal of cordial relations with England, he wrote back on March 28, 1536, a most diplomatic reply, in which he pointed out that it would be certainly for the interest of the Princess that Anne Boleyn should continue to be Henry’s wife; for should the King marry again, he might have male issue, which would succeed to the prejudice of Mary: there was, on the other hand, little probability that Anne would bear Henry another child, and the Emperor knew well that in the eyes of the nation his cousin’s right was far superior to that of Elizabeth. So, by a very extraordinary turn of affairs, the interests of Charles and of Anne had at least temporarily become identical. Cromwell probably had not perceived that this was the true state of affairs when he had his conversation with Chapuys; but the failure of his attempts to bring about a Spanish alliance must have opened his eyes to the fact that he had been working in the interests of one whose ruin had been certainly resolved on by this time. ‘He took to his bed out of pure sorrow’ for a few days as we are told; and when he returned to the Court, it was to labour with all his might for the ruin of Anne, which he saw was necessary to save his own credit with the King.

Driven by political necessity, William in 1543 finally took the decisive step, and declared himself ready to introduce the new religion into his dominions, in the hope of gaining aid from his brother-in-law against the Emperor. But the offer came too late. The political situation had changed once more, and the overcautious Elector now definitely and unconditionally refused the aid which he had before made dependent on William’s acceptance of Lutheranism. The lands of the Duke were invaded by the Imperial forces, and William was forced, at the treaty of Venlo, Sept. 7, 1543, to renounce all claims to Gelderland and Zutphen, to return to the Church of Rome, and to permit no religious innovations in Juliers and Berg. Subsequently, however, encouraged by the milder attitude of the Emperor Ferdinand towards the Reformers, he devoted himself with partial success to an attempt to effect a sort of compromise between the two faiths in his own possessions, and to establish there a purified and enlightened Catholic Church, ‘Erasmian’ in its tendencies, and in many respects approaching very closely to the tenets of the Augsburg Confession.

The martyrologist Foxe tells an amusing and characteristic story of Cromwell’s saving Cranmer from punishment for a book which he had written against the Six Articles. There appears to have been a bear-baiting on the Thames before the King, which Mr. Ralph Morice, Cranmer’s secretary, was watching from a small boat: and the secretary, it seems, had the Archbishop’s book in his girdle for safekeeping. The bear broke loose from the dogs and upset the wherry in which Morice was; in the tumult which ensued he lost the precious book. It was subsequently picked up by the ‘bearward,’ who perceiving what it was, and being himself a violent papist, gave it to a priest of his religion, who told the bearward that whosoever wrote it would be hanged if the King should see it. The bearward endeavoured to give it to some influential Catholic at the Court, utterly refusing to listen to Morice’s entreaties that he should return it to Cranmer. At this juncture Cromwell appeared upon the scene, and so ‘shaked up the bearward for his over-much malapertness’ that the latter was glad to return the book to the secretary, and so escape without further punishment. Foxe, vol. ii. p. 428.</p>

If this story be true, the interest which the King evinced in Cromwell’s letter is to be explained rather by his anxiety concerning his divorce, than by his sympathy for his fallen minister. Certainly there is no reason to think the closing scene of the ‘Life and Death of Thomas Lord Cromwell,’ in which a reprieve is brought from the King by Ralph Sadler after Cromwell’s head had fallen, has any foundation in fact.</p>

<p>Hyphenation and punctuation have been corrected and standardised.
Cromwell’s letters, however, have been fully retained according to the
original text; no changes in spelling have been applied here.</p>

<p>Numbered ranges have been expanded in full, i.e. 1595-6 is now
1595-1596. Dittoes in the Table of Contents have been eliminated by
insertion of appropriate text. Internal references have been adapted
to match the numbering scheme used in this electronic version.</p>

<p>The following passages have been changed:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 28: &sbquo;England and Francis&lsquo; &rarr; &sbquo;<a href="#francis">England and France</a>&lsquo;</li>
<li>Footnote 240: &sbquo;Harl. MSS 6, 148&lsquo; &rarr; &sbquo;<a href="#Footnote_240_240">Harl. MSS 6,148</a>&lsquo;</li>
</ul>
